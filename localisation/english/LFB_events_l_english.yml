COX_BRY.1.t: "The Resonance of Idealism"
COX_BRY.1.d: "Marheyev felt drowsy. \n\n Ever since Sablin announced the uprising against Yagoda's tyranny on the radio, he had been awake for almost forty-eight hours. Where were Yagoda's reinforcements now? What was the situation in the northern part of Lake Baikal? Was the NKVD's infiltration operation already underway? There was still so much work left to do, but revolutionary passion couldn't overcome the body's natural instincts; he was utterly exhausted. \n\n Perhaps he needed a cup of coffee, he thought. But in the remote Baikal region, such a thing was not easy to come by. The objects before Marheyev's eyes began to blur, and if it weren't for the timely shout from the radio operator, he might have dozed off. \n\n 'Comrade Mishka, we intercepted a strange radio call! It's only a few kilometers from our standoff line with the Presidium on the southern shore of Lake Baikal!' \n\n The sudden news jolted Marheyev awake. He rushed to the radio, watching the flickering indicator light. It was an unfamiliar signal. The uprising had occurred suddenly, and the militia divisions fighting on the northern shore of Lake Baikal had no military radios. The only regular army unit under the Buryat Soviet's control did not use this frequency. Who would be calling them under such circumstances? \n\n 'Send a message to the Third Division, ask them to check the radio frequencies of the Presidium's units.' \n\n 'But...' The radio operator hesitated. \n\n 'It's fine, send the message,' Marheyev waved his hand. 'Our radio has been monitored by those NKVD bastards from the start; there's no secrecy left.' \n\n The small command tent fell silent for a moment. Perhaps due to the rough terrain, the response signal from the advancing Third Division was unclear. Marheyev strained to listen, but could only catch bits and pieces of the conversation. However, he noticed that the radio operator's face grew increasingly pale as the conversation progressed, and by the time the call ended, it was practically ashen. \n\n 'That signal... it's from the Chinese Guard Infantry Brigade,' the radio operator shook his head. 'A brave and honorable unit, one of Yagoda's proudest assets. Mishka, you know what this means.' \n\n The Chinese Brigade. Just a few kilometers from the standoff line. Marheyev's head began to ache. He knew this unit had moved into attack positions; they could launch an assault at any moment, and no one could stop them. Why were they calling the Buryat military radio under these circumstances? Was it to flaunt their superior decryption skills? \n\n '...Mishka, they're still trying to call us. Should we respond?' \n\n 'Go ahead. It's probably just a surrender demand...' \n\n Marheyev slumped heavily into his campaign chair after speaking. He heard the radio crackle, then connect. The soldiers in the tent put down their work and listened with tense anticipation. \n\n Then, a strong male voice rang out—"

COX_BRY.2.t: "Morning Paper"
COX_BRY.2.d: "'Extra, extra! Another unit has joined our ranks; the tyrant's reign is coming to an end!' \n\n The sky over Ulan-Ude was just beginning to brighten, but the streets were already bustling. Trams loaded with passengers rumbled by, workers heading to their shifts, lunchboxes in hand, discussing the front lines' situation. Valery Sablin was among them, and as he passed a newsboy, the boy unceremoniously thrust a newspaper into his hand. \n\n 'Comrade, take a look at today's front page! Great news, I bet you'll love it!' \n\n Sablin smiled at the boy and took the paper. He already knew what the headline would be—Marheyev had told him last night—but he was still curious about how the comrades in the propaganda department would report the event. He unfolded the paper and was greeted by a super-long headline: \n\n 'The Brave and Honorable Chinese Guard Infantry Brigade Joins the Revolutionary Forces, Delivering a Heavy Blow to Yagoda's Tyranny' \n\n The front page then took up half the space detailing the brigade's history: how they fought in the West Russian War under Marshal Voroshilov, how they crossed the snow-covered expanses of Russia to the Far East under the banner of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and how they decided to rise against Yagoda's rule. The article passionately described: 'Under the leadership of Comrade Seryozha, they bravely crossed the snowfields ravaged by the wolves of the law, untouched by the glitz of Zlatoust, unmoved by Secretary Kaganovich and his roaring industrial heart... In Tomsk, the bourgeoisie in their salons demanded armed surveillance as they passed through, but they were not intimidated and bravely reached the Far East, finding their organization once again.' \n\n Sablin read as he walked, shaking his head with a smile. While most of the account was accurate, it was overly sentimental and exaggerated. He could understand the comrades' excitement, but the report read like a mirror image of Yagoda's radio speech when he first welcomed the Chinese Brigade. After finishing the front page, Sablin tucked the newspaper under his arm and hurried to the temporary Soviet Central headquarters nearby. As he approached the door, he heard Otto muttering inside. \n\n 'What were the propaganda department thinking... What did they publish in today's paper? The Guard Infantry Brigade isn't just composed of veterans from the front lines; it also includes remnants of the Chinese and Kazakh Red Army, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, and Buryats, but they didn't mention any of that on the front page! I need to talk to the head of the propaganda department!' \n\n Sablin stood quietly at the door, smiling to himself. When he raised his hand to knock, he had already made up his mind."
COX_BRY.2.a: "Why not visit the Chinese Brigade headquarters yourself?"

COX_BRY.3.t: "Surprise Attack Plan: 1962.1.6"
COX_BRY.3.d: "Gusinoozyorsk, a small town on the southern shore of Lake Baikal. Normally, this town, surrounded by fir forests and with a permanent population barely reaching ten thousand, would go unnoticed; now, it had become one of the front-line bases for the Buryat Soviet's operations against the Presidium, and the Chinese Guard Infantry Brigade was stationed here. \n\n Sablin had arrived with a batch of weapons and ammunition. Though the railway workers voluntarily worked overtime, the existing railway capacity barely met supply demands, making it impossible to allocate a separate carriage for him. He had sweated profusely in the boiler room and then shivered in the cold wind on the way to the camp, trying to control his trembling body while observing the surroundings. Along the way, he saw many soldiers from the Chinese Brigade. Since they hadn't had time to change into new uniforms, they wore red armbands to identify themselves. Besides this, their spirit was no different from other uprising forces in Buryatia. \n\n 'Comrade Sablin!' \n\n The sudden shout surprised Sablin. He looked up to see a group of men in thick coats approaching, led by a man who appeared middle-aged but with graying hair, looking prematurely aged from overwork. He smiled and extended his hand to Sablin, who shook it in return. \n\n 'You must be Comrade Sablin, right? Otto told us you'd be coming. We've been waiting in the camp, and just as we decided to take a walk, we ran into you...' \n\n Noticing the man's distinctly East Asian features, Sablin finally realized that he was shaking hands with Mao Anying, the commander of the Chinese Guard Infantry Brigade and a hero of the West Russian War. In an instant, countless curiosities flooded his mind—Yagoda had always boasted about the Chinese Brigade's visit as an acknowledgment of his so-called 'supreme leadership,' painting their story as something extraordinary. What was the truth? Sablin wanted to ask, but Mao Anying seemed to have guessed his thoughts and smiled, shaking his head. \n\n 'We’ll have time to discuss all that later. Right now, there's something more important I want to talk about with you.' \n\n Mao Anying took a military map of Irkutsk Province from one of his men, spread it out in front of Sablin. The map was covered with red and blue pencil markings. Although Sablin wasn't well-versed in military symbols, he could understand that the largest red arrow pointed from Gusinoozyorsk straight to the Irkutsk Dam. \n\n 'Yagoda's core area of control radiates outward from the dam. If we can capture the dam and cut off their power supply, the Presidium won't last long,' Mao Anying said, pointing to the dam's location. 'Yagoda's troops are mostly deployed in the north; the south is only defended by a motorized division. I plan to launch the attack immediately before the NKVD units in Irkutsk can regroup. Therefore, I hope to get assistance from the Third Infantry Division... Even without assistance, we will still attack, but the odds of success will be much lower.' \n\n Sablin carefully studied the map. He had to admit, it was an extremely risky plan, but they had a chance to end the civil war in the shortest time and liberate the people of Irkutsk from tyranny. After all, this uprising was a gamble from the start, and since the Third Infantry Division's task was to defend the southern front, what reason was there not to take the risk?"
COX_BRY.3.a: "Let's execute the plan as you suggested, Comrade Seryozha."

COX_BRY.4.t: "Traitors to Communism"
COX_BRY.4.d: "Xie Fuzhi walked briskly down the empty streets of Irkutsk. \n\n The war was over. Earlier today, the vanguard of the Chinese Guard 88th Brigade had entered the dam area, successfully cutting off the Presidium's power supply after eliminating weak resistance from the garrison, and Yagoda had been captured. This shriveled old man sat in his darkened underground command post, clutching a pistol, waiting for his fate—when the Chinese Brigade soldiers burst through the iron door, Yagoda launched an attack but failed to hit anyone before being pinned to the ground, unable to commit suicide by gunshot. Now, Xie Fuzhi, following the brigade commander's orders, was leading the military police to escort Yagoda to the train station, where he would be sent back to Ulan-Ude to face the people's court. \n\n 'A bunch of traitors.' \n\n Due to fears that the NKVD units had planted explosives in the city center for a final stand, the residents of Irkutsk had been evacuated, leaving the city eerily silent. Despite Yagoda being at the back of the convoy, Xie Fuzhi still heard him speak. \n\n 'What did you say?' \n\n The crunch of boots on rubble halted. Xie Fuzhi signaled the convoy to stop and approached Yagoda. The NKVD chief hadn't been tied up or handcuffed, only disarmed, so he now stared coldly at Xie Fuzhi, as if oblivious to the accusation in his words. Xie Fuzhi then remembered he hadn't spoken in Russian, so he repeated the question in Russian. \n\n 'What did you just say?' \n\n 'I should have known you would betray us,' Yagoda's eyes blazed with anger. 'You—Mongols, Buryats, Kazakhs—you've destroyed the Soviet! You've ruined the last hope of the Russian people! The 88th Brigade is full of traitors; I should have seen it coming!' \n\n Xie Fuzhi sighed, letting the old man continue his tirade. He pulled out a broken cigarette from his chest pocket, struck a match, and took a deep drag. The smoke, mingling with the cold Russian air, reminded him of the last years of guerrilla warfare in the snow-covered mountains of Northeast China—except back then, even a broken cigarette was a rare luxury, and fire was almost impossible to obtain. In those days, the Anti-Japanese United Army made a decision to retreat into Russian territory to seek help from the highest Presidium. Yagoda had indeed extended a hand, but during the long nights in Irkutsk, Xie Fuzhi never felt like a revolutionary soldier, only a servant at Yagoda's beck and call. He had peeled countless potatoes, participated in countless political rallies as a 'Chinese friend,' and endured Yagoda's endless inspections and applause. If he could choose again, he would rather have stayed in the mountains of Northeast China, fighting the Japanese to the last drop of blood, than waste away in the monitored comfort of the city. \n\n The cigarette was almost gone. Xie Fuzhi took one last drag and looked at Yagoda, who was still muttering curses against the Buryats. \n\n 'Heinrich Yagoda, you have no right to speak to us like that.' \n\n He flicked the cigarette butt to the ground and gently crushed it."

COX_BRY.5.t: "Setting Out"
COX_BRY.5.d: "The morning mist rose from Lake Baikal, and the streetlights of Irkutsk gradually went out as the industrial city on the Yenisei River awoke once more. The camp of the Chinese Guard 88th Brigade was busier than usual, with soldiers dismantling tents and eagerly discussing life after the revolution's victory. Daily life had returned to normal, and the scars left by the war were being gradually erased by machinery and laborers. Today, they would depart for Ulan-Ude for rest. \n\n 'Comrade Seryozha!' \n\n A few Buryat soldiers leading horses called out loudly to Mao Anying. Mao was helping the signalmen move the radio onto a truck, and when he heard the shout, he turned and waved to indicate his location. \n\n Though the soldiers could rest briefly, he still had a mission to complete. The officers and soldiers of the 88th Brigade were appointed as a temporary diplomatic mission, tasked with informing the Black Army in Western Siberia of the regime change. This might have been due to the 88th Brigade's previous feat of crossing Russia, or simply because they were closer to the Black Army; in any case, Mao Anying hadn't dwelled on the reason. His belongings had long been packed, and after securing them, he took the reins from the Buryat soldier, mounted the horse, and prepared to set off. \n\n 'Head north for twenty kilometers, and you'll see a radar station in the fields. Our trucks are parked there. The roads in northern Irkutsk Province are in poor condition, and the power hasn't been fully restored, so it's best to depart immediately.' \n\n 'Understood.'"
COX_BRY.5.a: "Let's see how the anarchists are faring."

COX_BRY.6.t: "Visiting the Anarchist Soviet"
COX_BRY.6.d: "In the haze, Mao Anying felt as if someone was tapping his shoulder, saying something to him. He tried to listen, but the voice was too faint, too distant, and he couldn't grasp it. \n\n '...Wanderer, do not long for home...' \n\n Mao Anying abruptly opened his eyes. But no one was beside him; he had simply fallen asleep in the bumpy truck, his shoulder jostled. He sighed, wiped the condensation from the truck's window, and looked outside. The white snow and frozen tundra of Siberia flowed tirelessly past. \n\n The revolution had triumphed. To quickly spread this news to potential allies of the Buryat Soviet, Mao Anying and several Buryat representatives had visited the Siberian Anarchist Soviet, and today was the last day of the state visit. The Black Army had arranged a truck to take them to the border, where Buryat forces would meet them. The days spent in Kansk had been pleasant; though the Black Army politely declined to offer any substantial aid to Buryatia, they still sent their blessings to the newly established Soviet government. Mao Anying had even been invited to dance a Cossack dance with the commune's leader, Yuri, a dance that left him utterly exhausted. \n\n 'Although we have no reason to refuse industrial technical exchanges, this matter still needs to be communicated to the communes at all levels for consent... I know you hold different beliefs than we do, but I still wish you luck, my friend.' \n\n Remembering Yuri's parting words, Mao Anying rubbed his eyes and looked out the window again. Perhaps—just perhaps—a country entirely managed by communes could indeed succeed... At least, in the Anarchist Soviet, he saw the same vitality and vigor as in Buryatia. \n\n '...fight...fight your way back inland...' \n\n On the other side of the truck, Xie Fuzhi, equally tired, was mumbling in his sleep. He had been muttering the same phrases in his sleep for a long time. Mao Anying smiled unconsciously—neither the Black Army nor Buryatia would be his final destination. Whenever he saw the people here, content and satisfied, he couldn't help but think of the millions of Chinese still under the Japanese yoke, whose rights had been stripped away for far too long, and the soldiers of the Chinese Brigade, who had been away from home for far too long. \n\n No matter how, he had to bring the revolution back to China; if the citizens of the Black Army and Buryatia could live with pride and dignity, then all Chinese people should enjoy the same rights."

COX_BRY.7.t: "Gazing Over the Grasslands"
COX_BRY.7.d: "The Chinese Brigade had been marching across the vast Siberian plains for several days. \n\n They had initially traveled by truck from Irkutsk, but after heavy rains on the third day turned the plains into a quagmire, the soldiers had to abandon some of their supplies and vehicles, continuing on foot. \n\n Mao Anying had heard stories of the Red Army crossing grasslands. He thought many of the details were likely exaggerated by later generations, but the current situation surpassed even those tales—each step on the sodden grass was cautious, each step added more mud to their boots, each step was heavier than the last. Unlike the torrential rains of the Central Plains, Siberia's drizzle was unending, and the unique cold of this region penetrated all layers of clothing, freezing the soldiers' limbs as if they were no longer their own. \n\n After crossing a hill, the Chinese Brigade decided to camp in a sheltered spot to rest. \n\n Mao Anying and several commanders climbed to higher ground to plan the next day's march. Where there were paths, where there were villages or people, where supply trucks could pass, where there were waterlogged valleys... After completing these assessments, Mao Anying looked up at the sky—gray clouds covered the sky, and cold rain seemed ready to fall at any moment. He shook his head and looked north. At that moment, the people on the shores of Lake Baikal were likely engaged in the fervent construction of their newly born Soviet Republic. Sablin's parting blessing echoed in his ears— \n\n 'May our revolutions succeed soon, may we both defeat imperialism.' \n\n The newly born revolutionary flame was so fragile; how could Anying not want to protect it? But the Chinese Brigade could not linger. They had to traverse this new Long March, reach their suffering homeland, and bring the light of hope born on the shores of Lake Baikal, at any cost... \n\n Thinking of this, Mao Anying looked west again—"

COX_BRY.8.t: "Anesthetic"
COX_BRY.8.d: "'Comrade Krikalev, you really should cut back on the smoking and drinking.' \n\n The military doctor moved the stethoscope on Krikalev's chest, his face showing concern. This middle-aged Russian had been forced to leave the front lines due to severe coughing a few days ago, but now he stood with his chest bared, unconcerned as the cold metal instrument moved around. \n\n 'What can I say? How could one not smoke or drink...' Krikalev muttered. 'Ah, doctor, can I put my clothes back on now?' \n\n After receiving the affirmative, he quickly pulled down his rolled-up shirt. The stethoscope must have been too cold, as Krikalev stifled a few coughs. Once his breathing steadied, he continued speaking. \n\n 'When you're feeling down, you want to light up a few and take a swig... Comrade, I've had some education; I know smoking and drinking aren't good for you. You don't need to tell me; I'm well aware that my lungs and guts are probably full of holes by now.' He scratched his thinning hair. 'But quitting is easier said than done. You see, I have an old mother at home, and a son who's still a minor—my wife, well, she left long ago, said I was a deadbeat. Every night, when I think about my son not getting an education and not being able to find work, and my mother tossing and turning in bed with her back pain, how can I not worry? So, I have to drink and smoke; it's the only way I can sleep...' \n\n As he spoke, he stood up, grabbed the coat draped over the chair, and slipped it on. \n\n 'Doctor, I don't have anything serious, just some old issues. Please, just write me a report so I can return to the unit.' \n\n 'I believe I told you, if you don't cut back on smoking and drinking...' \n\n 'Comrade.' Krikalev turned around, looking at the confused doctor. A powerful light shone from his murky old eyes. \n\n 'You don't need to worry. The frontline of the struggle is the best medicine. Though it's muddy and cold, I always have something to look forward to, and I don't feel down at all. When I think about our cause, I'm full of energy.'"

COX_BRY.9.t: "Hometown Accent and Lake Baikal"
COX_BRY.9.d: "Old Qian sat in the guard post by Lake Baikal. The recent heavy rains had turned the roads outside into a muddy mess, and the strong winds of recent days had toppled trees, blocking the roads. It would likely be several days before supplies could arrive. He wasn't concerned about that; he simply puffed on his cigarette and listened to the radio. A few days ago, Comrade Braun had sternly condemned Yagoda's revisionist tyranny in heavily accented Russian; today, the broadcaster was enthusiastically announcing that the party congress had unanimously supported Comrade Sablin's election as General Secretary. Afterward, Sablin's speech at the congress was broadcast. Though his voice was still young, it was filled with the most scarce things in Russia: idealism and determination. Wherever it might be, fighting for the cause of human liberation was always glorious. Comrade Mao Anying had said so, and Old Qian truly believed it too. But now, as he listened to the exuberant 'Ura!' cheers following Sablin's speech, Old Qian felt a sense of loss. \n\n There were no more voices on the radio, and the Internationale began to play. This was the fixed tune during the radio station's break. Old Qian didn't know what he was waiting for. He didn't bother to turn off the radio, which never broadcast in Chinese, nor did he have any interest in looking at Lake Baikal, which seemed like it would never thaw. \n\n The Internationale gradually faded from the broadcast, and in his half-asleep state, Old Qian vaguely heard the broadcaster's voice. She spoke in Russian: \n\n 'We now... in the battle against the revisionist tyrant... the commander of the Chinese Brigade and the son of the revolutionary hero... Comrade Mao Anying is addressing all overseas Chinese comrades!' Then, the radio emitted a familiar Chinese voice: 'Good afternoon, soldiers of the 88th Guard Brigade, all overseas Chinese listening, and all citizens of the glorious Republic!' \n\n Old Qian suddenly sat up, hastily turning the radio's volume knob to maximum. Just as he was about to focus intently on Mao Anying's speech, a loud rumbling came from outside the howling wind. Old Qian instinctively put on his helmet, grabbed the gun by his bed, and rushed out. Was it a hardliner or fascist attack? But who would stage an attack on this remote lakeside? \n\n He burst out of the guard post, looking around in confusion. There were no reactionaries, only the howling wind and the warming sun breaking through the dense black clouds, along with the surging waves of Lake Baikal that tore apart the long-frozen ice. Massive chunks of ice were pushed ashore by the waves, destined to melt. \n\n '...The Party has officially decided: we will leave Russian soil to fight for the liberation of the Chinese people!' The familiar hometown accent mingled with the howling wind in Old Qian's ears, as tears and bullet casings fell into his knapsack."

Recently, after hearing of the People's Revolutionary Committee's significant victory in the war against Japan in Mongolia, the people of Buryatia held a celebration. Following Comrade Mao Anying's recommendation, Comrade Vasilevsky sent representatives to the Buryat Soviet to discuss cooperation. \n\n After brief discussions, the Buryat Soviet and the People's Revolutionary Committee decided to cooperate on the disposal of some surplus resources. For example, the Buryat Soviet would connect the old alliance power grid between the two regions, ensuring the continued production in the industrial areas left by the Central Siberian Plan under the People's Revolutionary Committee's jurisdiction. Meanwhile, the People's Revolutionary Committee would provide machine tools to Buryatia, enhancing its industrial production.

COX_BRY.11.d: "With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the great nation of Russia had fallen to its lowest point. Its people wandered the barren land, lacking everything but one thing that filled their warehouses—tales of heroism passed down through the ages. \n\n On a day when the ice and snow of Lake Baikal were about to melt, a traveler stepped into a lakeside tavern. Ignoring the disdainful look from the owner, he strode in with his mud-caked boots, sat down at a wooden table, and ordered a glass of vodka to warm his cold body. \n\n 'Do you accept yen here?' After gulping down a mouthful of vodka, the man asked. \n\n As soon as he spoke, everyone in the tavern who was still sober turned to look at him. \n\n 'We only accept Irkutsk rubles.' \n\n 'That currency has devalued so much; why are you still using it?' \n\n 'Because this isn't Vladivostok, and it isn't Samara either,' the owner said firmly. 'The Japanese yen might be hard currency in the east and south, but here, it can't get you anything except an "amicable greeting" from the NKVD.' \n\n 'Then... would these boots be enough to pay for the drink?' \n\n 'Those worn-out boots alone? No, I wouldn't even bother washing them,' the owner picked up the vodka glass and refilled it. 'But if they’ve walked a certain path, they might be worth another drink... It's been a long time since anyone came from farther east, and this room full of old drunks would love to hear what’s become of the Far East we’re all so familiar with.' \n\n By now, the man was surrounded by a crowd eager to hear his story. It seemed that if his tale failed to satisfy, he would have to offer more than just his boots. The man took a deep breath— the surrounding stench of alcohol made him cough—then gulped down another mouthful of vodka— \n\n 'I come from Kamchatka, the farthest east of the mainland...' \n\n 'I heard the Japanese occupy that place?' 'Nonsense, it's a state of the United States now.' 'What are you guessing for? It's obviously a German supply station, like I've always said. Their submarines can sail under the northern ice...' \n\n 'Cough, cough...' The man coughed loudly, and the tavern's buzzing quieted down after a while. 'It's the last stronghold of the Russian navy—I’m certain of that. Because I set out from there. The sailors of the Pacific Fleet control the ports and cities, and the militias have set up checkpoints, controlling the entire peninsula. They even have a battleship—the October Revolution. I once served honorably on it. Yumashev—a Soviet-era admiral—commands the surviving Pacific Fleet and the entire Kamchatka Peninsula...' \n\n 'Then why did you leave?' \n\n '...Sigh.' The man sighed and downed his drink. 'A tired old captain, commanding a bunch of decrepit old ships, patrolling the coast of a shattered nation. I felt like I was lying in a coffin, except I could still breathe because my undertaker had died... The salty, cold sea wind out there is no better than it is here.' \n\n Perhaps one day, it would become the cornerstone of a new Russian navy, or perhaps the guns of the October Revolution would shake the world, and the courage of the sailors would once again ignite Russia's passion—"

PRC.2000.t:"Meeting in the Cold Spring"
PRC.2000.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Spring in Siberia is always short and unpredictable, and even on the westernmost plateau of Mongolia, the biting cold still lingers. Vasilevsky walked through the unthawed snow, across the slippery grasslands, and into the temporarily erected military camp. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu He was here to meet with Mao Anying. About half a month ago, the Buryat Soviet sent a diplomatic statement to the Committee, informing them that Yagoda's rule had been overthrown, and mentioning a unit that wished to pass through western Mongolia on its way back to China. As for the final fate of the Presidium, Vasilevsky didn't care; in fact, Yagoda was never part of the exiled Red Army's plans. What concerned him was this Chinese unit. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Two Red Army soldiers with East Asian faces opened the felt door of the tent, allowing Vasilevsky and his entourage to enter. The tent wasn't large, and he could immediately see the famous Chinese general. Mao Anying was standing by an erected map, but upon hearing the noise at the entrance, he turned around and saluted Vasilevsky. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Marshal, I'm sorry to trouble you to inspect... According to our previous agreement, the Chinese Brigade won't stay on your territory for long, so there's no need for you to personally—' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'On the contrary,' Vasilevsky extended his hand, trying to appear sincere, 'The People's Revolutionary Committee hopes that you and your troops can stay a little longer. You know, the situation with the Mongolian People's Front is not optimistic; Prince De and the Japanese will soon push the front to western Mongolia, and we need as many troops as possible to...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu He didn't continue—after all, it was an unreasonable request. But for the safety of the Tuva base, he had to make it. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu After a long while, Vasilevsky felt his outstretched hand being firmly grasped. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'We hope you can provide us with some accurate maps of western Mongolia.' Mao Anying still held the old marshal's hand, 'The Chinese Brigade is happy to fight alongside the Red Army. However, once the situation calms down, we still have to leave, and we hope you can understand.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Vasilevsky took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. He couldn't think of how to respond, so he clicked his heels together and gave a standard military salute to the Chinese general in front of him."

As a member of the logistics escort unit, Valentin had no chance to touch the advanced weapons that only combat units could get their hands on. All he could do was hold his breath and try to hit the approaching enemy with his outdated rifle. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Of course, whether this was really effective, he wasn't sure. But at least he had survived until now—just as he was thinking this, Valentin felt someone push him. He turned his head and saw a few East Asian faces staring straight at him. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade, are you feeling unwell?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Valentin exhaled a long breath. The tinnitus and dizziness from holding his breath disappeared, and he could hear the neighing of horses and the crisp sound of carbine fire. He peeked out from behind the cover and saw the Mengjiang cavalry charging head-on, the rolling dust kicked up by their iron hooves making even the reflection of their sabers appear blurry. At that moment, Valentin realized that today he was not the prey of Japanese lackeys but a fierce hunter—although he still held an outdated rifle, his comrades beside him were genuine Guards Infantry, and the dogs of Prince De were completely unaware of this. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu In an instant, many images flashed through Valentin's mind: carts loaded with rye burning fiercely, his comrade lying on the ground covered in blood, clutching a weapon with all its bullets spent. These tragedies would not be repeated today. The damned Mongolian fascists dared to think they could easily crush the Red Army by repeatedly attacking logistics units; now they would pay for their arrogance with their own blood! \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Valentin leaped to his feet. His rifle aimed at the lead cavalryman, who was waving his saber with both hands as if certain there would be no resistance, but he was gravely mistaken. Valentin's gun fired, followed by a barrage of gunfire."

PRC.2002.d:"£gezifu £gezifu The night wind on the Mongolian plateau was biting cold. Valentin sat by the campfire, holding his tin mess kit and spooning stew into his mouth. The stew was as tasteless as ever, the cold on the plateau was still bone-chilling, his chest was warm, but his back, which couldn't feel the fire's warmth, was almost frozen. Everything seemed unchanged, except for one thing—his old semi-automatic rifle was gone, replaced by a slightly used automatic weapon. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'How's it feel?' A Chinese soldier sitting next to Valentin put an arm around him, 'This is the combat unit you longed for, how do you feel?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Valentin swallowed the stew in his mouth and smiled awkwardly. His regiment had been promoted to a combat unit for ambushing Mengjiang puppet troops and still followed the Chinese Brigade on missions, so not much had changed. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu '...It's, it's okay.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Okay?' The Chinese soldier laughed heartily, 'I think you're about to freeze! Here, take a swig of this.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu He handed Valentin a canteen without giving him a choice. Valentin took a careful sip, and a fiery, slightly sweet warmth flowed down his throat. Experience told him that the canteen was filled with alcohol, but the taste was much better than the local stuff in Dund-us. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade, this—' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Valentin turned his head and saw a big mischievous grin on the canteen owner's face. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'It's Yagoda's prized stuff. The Buryat boys are quite capable; they intercepted a train headed for Irkutsk, and besides weapons and ammunition, it was full of crates of alcohol. It was all divided up and used to keep warm, and I got a little bit, but I couldn't bring myself to finish it all.' He tapped the canteen Valentin was holding, 'It's good stuff, but there's not much left. You might as well finish it!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Valentin took another gulp from the canteen. He had never drunk anything so strong before, and this swig was too much, causing him to cough repeatedly. The Chinese soldier patted his back, saying something, but Valentin didn't really hear it."

PRC.2003.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Ananiyevich felt that no one in the world could have a worse job than his. Although finding a job in Dund-us wasn't easy, being assigned to manage a telegraph machine that no one would ever connect to wasn't much better than being unemployed. He straightened up in his seat, yawning long and reaching for his canteen. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The telegraph machine had been personally ordered to be protected by Marshal Vasilevsky during the Red Army's retreat eastward. The original idea was to maintain basic communication capabilities, but for years, it had never been called upon. In such a hopeless work environment, being forced to slack off was inevitable—most people would choose to bring a newspaper to read or chat quietly, and at the very least, they could take a nap on the table. The small, quiet room seemed to mirror the state of post-collapse Russia, where hope always existed but was elusive. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Ananiyevich rummaged through the clutter of newspapers and waste paper and finally found his canteen. As he reached out to grab the small tin container, he felt the table vibrating slightly. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Telegraph! Telegraph!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu After a moment of silence, a surprised shout rang out. The telegraph machine, sitting in the corner and produced in the late forties, looked quite old and outdated but was now whirring as it spit out a long strip of paper. Ananiyevich, holding his canteen, watched in confusion as his colleague rushed toward the telegraph machine. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'B-u-r-y-a-t S-o-v-i-e-t...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Notebook! Who's got a pen that works?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The paper tape flowed through the telegrapher's hands as the first message in over a decade was slowly but surely decoded. The telegraph machine was now tightly surrounded, and Ananiyevich couldn't get in, so he stood on tiptoe to look inside. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Anasha!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu '...Present!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The supervisor suddenly called out Ananiyevich's name, and he quickly stood at attention. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Go find Comrade Anisim and tell him to prepare to send a message to the 88th Guards Infantry Brigade, quick!'"

I just want to go back and see my hometown one last time...' Vasilevsky said with a hint of melancholy. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'That young man by Lake Baikal is the one with energy. It was after hearing his broadcast that I decided to join him,' Mao Anying said, glancing in the direction of Lake Baikal. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'That kid's name is Sablin, isn't it? Overthrew Yagoda... well, it’s better than having that old fox as a neighbor. Always felt like he would stab you in the back...' Vasilevsky thought for a moment before saying, 'That kid has passion, and it's comfortable being his neighbor. No need to worry about a knife in the back.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Just after saying this, Vasilevsky suddenly sighed and said, 'Being with you makes me feel like the Soviets have successors, and socialism has new hope.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'My father once wrote a sentence to encourage Chinese communists, something like, "A single spark can start a prairie fire." You, Sablin, me, and General Baurzhan in Kazakhstan, along with many generals in Western Russia, we are all sparks of socialism. As long as we unite, one day we will see the Soviets return to the land,' Mao Anying said. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu After hearing this, Vasilevsky laughed and said, 'Unity, yes, but I’m not interested in going to Lake Baikal to be that kid’s assistant, at least not now. But socialism does need cooperation. We have some remnants of the Siberian Plan here, and the Irkutsk Power Station provides enough electricity, so cooperation between us would indeed be a win-win.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Vasilevsky patted Mao Anying on the shoulder, excitedly saying, 'My good comrade, because of your arrival, this wasteland has seen some change, and the power of socialism has been strengthened. You are the bond of our friendship!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Sincere cooperation among communists is the foundation of our strength,' Mao Anying nodded and said. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu After hearing this, Vasilevsky looked directly into Mao Anying's eyes and said seriously:"

Even when he escaped to the prairie and, inspired by ideals, joined the Red Army, he could only cower in a corner of Tuva. The enemies of Mother Russia came from all directions, but her remains were filled with people who hated each other. Could such a Russia ever truly deserve victory? \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Though the Revolutionary Committee declared new "victories" every day, Valentin knew that producing a few more rifles and killing a few bandits could be called a "victory," but it was too insignificant. Twenty years of rebuilding was too long, and even the most determined revolutionaries longed to witness a real victory—a great victory that would stir their souls. So, when the Mongolian revolution broke out, he volunteered, picked up his old rifle, and headed to western Mongolia. There, his comrades fought bravely but were eventually forced to retreat, and the enemy, emboldened by their victories, advanced further, attempting to crush the last revolutionary base. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu But the Tuva soldiers and civilians fought to the death, and with the unexpected support of allied forces, they finally defeated the invaders and achieved victory. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu At the victory feast, Valentin sat alone in a corner. Under the influence of alcohol, his expression was somewhat dazed. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade?' An East Asian soldier handed him a canteen, 'The last of Yagoda's private stash, want a sip?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Though he knew he was already a bit tipsy, Valentin took the canteen and took a big gulp. The strong liquor burned his throat, and warm tears flowed down his face. 'Have... have we really won?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, comrade, we defeated Prince De's lackeys!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Then... why aren't you drinking? Aren't we celebrating?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The Chinese Brigade leaves for Altay tomorrow morning to fight Sheng Shicai and his dogs... After Xinjiang, it's Yan'an, then Chongqing, and finally Nanjing and Beijing... We will liberate them, whether I'm alive or not by then... we will.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Our victories... are still far away,' Valentin said, raising the canteen high and draining its scorching contents.

In the simple capital of the People's Revolutionary Committee, which looked more like a military camp than a capital, the people were all smiles. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Bright red flags fluttered above the houses, and Mongolians, Russians, and Chinese, people of many different ethnicities, united under the same crimson banner, sang and danced with joy. The entire town was enveloped in a sea of red. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'We've received news from Xinjiang. There are still some former underground CCP members there. They say they can turn some of Sheng Shicai's troops to your side when you enter Xinjiang, helping you secure a base,' Vasilevsky said, somewhat happily, to Mao Anying, who was standing beside him. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu This was the most comforting moment he had experienced since entering Mongolia. Not only had he repelled the Mongolian attack with the help of the 88th Brigade, but he had also received news from his old comrades in Russia. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Thank you, General. The 88th Brigade will be leaving soon. We won't trouble you any longer,' Mao Anying replied politely. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Care for a smoke?' Vasilevsky asked, offering Mao Anying a hand-rolled cigarette. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I only smoke when I'm troubled,' Mao Anying said, accepting the cigarette and glancing southward, a hint of sadness in his eyes. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Like you, I'm a wanderer far from home. I understand how you feel,' Vasilevsky said, lighting Mao Anying's cigarette and then lighting his own. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying looked at the fluttering red flag, then turned back to Vasilevsky and said, 'General, I've traveled to many places over the years and seen different scenes across the Russian land. There are festering wounds everywhere, but at least there are still some torches of hope on Russian soil. You, the many generals in Western Russia, and Sablin by Lake Baikal, all represent hope for the people of Russia. But my homeland, China, is also under the terrifying rule of fascism. The people there suffer just as much as the Russian people, but I see no hope of awakening them.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu He paused for a moment, then said to Vasilevsky:"

He wished he could see his father, who existed only in his distant memories, one more time... but that thought had become a dream that would never come true. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'A total of 36 old M30 howitzers from the Great Patriotic War and matching shells—these are our gifts to you, comrades. Use them to liberate Xinjiang,' Vasilevsky said, standing beside some Mongolian volunteer veterans who would accompany the 88th Brigade on their southern campaign. He patted Mao Anying's shoulder and added. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying was also surprised by Vasilevsky's generosity—it was truly a selfless gift to the 88th Brigade. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Thank you so much, Marshal Vasilevsky,' Mao Anying said, shaking the old marshal's hand, 'Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu After General Vasilevsky left, Xie Fuzhi remarked, 'That old Soviet marshal seems to have a lot of humanity.'

PRC.2008.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Embracing ideals does not guarantee victory—Mao Anying had long known this truth. In the first half of his life in Russia, he witnessed the collapse of the Soviet Union and heard of the destruction of the revolution in his homeland. After that, he began to wander. On the post-war Russian land, countless revolutionaries, ambitious men, tyrants, and dictators rose. Mao Anying saw the rise of some of them and watched more ideals shatter—the dream of democracy in the Central Siberian Republic eventually crumbled, and Yagoda, once the defender of the Soviets, finally fell into the role of a cruel tyrant... Embracing ideals does not make a person invincible; more often than not, it leads him steadfastly to his own demise. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu And now, he was leading the entire Chinese Brigade along this path of certain death—as the high-explosive bombs ignited the prairie and the command post was surrounded by a network of fire, Mao Anying thought so. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu A few days ago, the Mengjiang army had broken through the Red Army's defenses, forcing the People's Revolutionary Committee's troops to retreat to the Tuva region. Due to being too deep behind enemy lines, the Chinese Brigade could not withdraw from western Mongolia in time. The situation took a sharp turn for the worse—the Mengjiang forces blocked the entire area, and on the vast prairie, Japanese bombers could drop bombs with impunity. The Chinese Brigade could only break through in companies under the cover of night... \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Just as the command post received word that most of the troops had successfully broken through and were beginning to breathe a sigh of relief, a whole squadron of Japanese bombers suddenly appeared on the horizon.

PRC.3000.d:"£gezifu £gezifu After the defeat in western Mongolia, the remnants of the Red Army, along with countless refugees, flooded into Tuva. Amid the chaos of defeat, the People's Revolutionary Committee still managed to reorganize its forces. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The temporary command post stood far from the front lines, and the incoming personnel were busy setting up facilities outside the command post, following the transport trucks. Despite having a new command center, the heavy sorrow still hung over everyone's heads: since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this army had fled to the Mongolian steppes as best it could. Despite the victory against Yagoda; despite the Far Eastern Red Army and the Mongolian People's Army forming an alliance in this red apocalypse; despite the revival being close at hand. But the damn Japanese and their Co-Prosperity Sphere lackeys had to destroy the last remnants of the Soviet Union in this desperate situation. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The result was that the defeated Red Army retreated to the Tuva Republic. Although the damaged vehicles had been repaired and the wounded soldiers had recovered, sadness had become the greatest affliction for these soldiers, who had experienced consecutive defeats and were now homeless. Despair grew among the refugees, spreading along the command chain. The Red Army soldiers were long accustomed to struggling in desperate circumstances, but the victory of the revolution seemed forever out of reach. Recently, a rumor had inevitably spread throughout the army—Yagoda had been overthrown, and the isolated forces in Tuva were now the last red faction in Russia. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Despite the low morale, the Red Army still managed to rebuild its defense system in the east and south. Due to the casualties among the veteran soldiers, the command post urgently needed personnel. Andrey Magorov was appointed in a crisis, having earned a commendation for relaying important intelligence (though it was bitter) in battle after the original informant was severely injured by artillery. Now, he continued to report border developments to the army's supreme commander—General Vasilevsky. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Normally, he would carry out his reporting duties methodically, but this time, he broke his usual composure, pushing through the crowd and rushing into the command post, bursting through the door to General Vasilevsky's office: but instead of the general himself, he was greeted by a soldier who usually ensured the general's safety. The soldier was sitting in a chair next to the main desk, cleaning his gun. However, the sudden entrance startled even this battle-hardened soldier. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Andrey! Thank goodness this gun isn't loaded, or one of us would have tasted a bullet!' the soldier complained, but realizing something was wrong, he asked, 'The general is sorting through his files elsewhere right now, has something happened at the front?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The border reported that an Asian-looking army has arrived.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Damn it, what!? Is it the Japanese or the damn Mongolians? Or someone else?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Andrey pursed his lips. Although he had anticipated the soldier's anger, he himself was not fully prepared for the news he was about to deliver."

As the supreme commander of the Far Eastern Red Army, your job now is to sort through what might be the last remnants of the Soviet Red Army and bind them into a book with those bureaucrats around you. For you, there’s never time to grieve, is there? \n\n£gezifu £gezifu As you organize the old gun experiment reports with a headache, two young men enter from outside, one being the newly promoted intelligence officer Andrey, and the other the soldier Hadambater who has always been by your side. You sigh, not even needing to think, knowing something has happened at the front. Though you are still that man who stands tall even in a foreign land, at least now, you’re tired, so you simply let them report the intelligence without saying much."
PRC.3001.a:"After the two exchange a glance, Andrey steps forward to speak to you..."
PRC.3002.t:"Make a Choice"
PRC.3002.d:"£gezifu £gezifu From Andrey's account, you learn what happened: during a routine night patrol on the northeastern border of Tuva, a cavalry unit spotted an approaching army of thousands, all wearing Soviet-style uniforms. The cavalry immediately rode through the night to report the situation to the nearest camp, where Andrey happened to be catching up with an officer friend. Given the urgency, the two ordered all the soldiers in the camp to stand by and had the cavalry notify nearby units to prepare for a possible conflict: normally, if there were enemy forces, they would only be small border patrols or bandits (although oddly, it had been unusually quiet in recent weeks). Given the current situation, the various Red factions were too far apart, and even in the worst-case scenario, it was unlikely that they would attack here. If it were the Japanese, they would have no reason to disguise themselves as Soviet troops. As a result, the officers at the camp predicted that these people likely had no hostile intent, but just in case, the assembled troops still lay in ambush, waiting for the order to fire. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Fortunately, the officers were right; these people were indeed not enemies. In fact, they were the once-famous "Chinese Brigade" (yes, those tough guys in a foreign land, no worse than Yagoda's NKVD, though they were still defeated by you and that group of scholars). The front lines were temporarily unsure why the "Chinese Brigade," which had once served Yagoda, had come here from Lake Baikal, why they were completely unarmed, and what exactly had happened in Yagoda's territory (you had only heard that there had been military conflict there and that the rebels seemed to have won). There were many more questions to ask later. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu But now, there are three more important matters: \n\n£gezifu £gezifu First, their ultimate goal is to pass through the Tuva Republic to reach Xinjiang (although they seem uncertain about where to go next). \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Second, these thousands of people are only part of the Chinese Brigade; at least three more groups of similar size are approaching. It is estimated that the total number of the "Chinese Brigade" will exceed 10,000 (yes, a brigade with over 10,000 people... you chuckle, remembering the laughable things that happened when you faced the "Chinese Brigade" while resisting Yagoda). However, they have promised to take on military tasks (or other duties within their capacity) during their assembly, and the gathering of the rest of their forces will not take too long. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Third, despite the previous conflicts, we can't just ignore them now that they are one of the few friendly armies left. Although they claim they don't need assistance, we must provide them with tents for shelter, and of course, supplies will have to be provided. (Thank heavens, Central Siberia is bountiful, and Tuva doesn't lack food or tents, but the thought of having to feed over 10,000 people still gives you a headache.) \n\n£gezifu £gezifu So now it's your turn to speak; you certainly can't turn them away, but how will you host the advance party?"

For the Chinese Red Army, this was yet another instance of relying on the hospitality of others, a situation they had lost count of. Although it felt like they were a step closer to home, it still seemed so far away. And even if they reached Xinjiang, what would they do next? \n\n£gezifu £gezifu But could they just let it go? No, that wasn't possible. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Xiao Jinhai, the Russian interpreter for the 2nd Battalion of the Chinese Brigade, had been discussing various events in the Far East with an officer of the border guard since the sun had barely set. The two talked for a long time, and many of the issues troubling the Far Eastern Red Army were resolved. However, as their conversation deepened, they both realized that something had to be done to ease the tension between the two sides. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu After discussing various possibilities, they decided to hold a bonfire party: what could break down barriers better than eating meat and drinking around a bonfire? \n\n£gezifu £gezifu So they set out to make it happen. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Tuva, though not wealthy, had a well-developed livestock industry, allowing the soldiers to easily (compared to those suffering from famine in the Russian interior) obtain enough food for a feast (mainly lamb, fish, and potatoes). Time was tight, so there was no time for elaborate preparations, but there was salt... As for the alcohol, naturally, it was vodka from the black market in Western Russia (even though the bottles were labeled with the black, yellow, and white flag). \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Late at night, the soldiers gathered around the fire, eating barbecue, and the alcohol broke down the barriers between the two sides. Some slightly drunk individuals were competing in strength, while others were slowly eating and chatting. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu At this point, a few soldiers brought over some instruments from the border guards, and Xiao Jinhai followed closely, stepping in front of the fire and pausing to let the soldiers present turn their attention to the bonfire. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Brothers,' he shouted, 'Tonight, to celebrate our safe return, I’ve arranged with the Russians to bring together some musicians from both sides. We’ll eat, drink, and sing together, how about it!?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Sounds good!' 'Let’s do it!'... Naturally, the response was enthusiastic. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu So, those who wanted to listen to music gathered around the fire, forming a circle around the firelight, drinking hot food and spicy alcohol, and singing with all their might. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu And so they sang and danced, from nightfall until dawn. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu And at the final moment, the displaced people sang together:"

However, after resting for just one night, they were once again on the move, this time invited to visit the Far Eastern Command in Tuva. But Wang Fu’an wasn't interested in that; he felt that the command had nothing much to offer, so he just wanted to wander around the city. Thus, he and a few comrades requested leave from the battalion commander to explore the city. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu So, early this morning, while those who preferred to rest in place watched, he and his comrades boarded the truck headed for the city. For these soldiers, the scenery along the way was less interesting than what they might do tomorrow, and their previous experiences in Mengjiang left them in no mood for conversation, so they rode in silence until they reached their destination. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Upon arrival, Wang Fu’an and his comrades walked through the streets, observing the people and buildings. He felt that there wasn't much difference between this place and Buryatia. The surroundings were mainly trees, with mountains encircling the city. The city was surrounded by snow-capped peaks, and the buildings within were either dirt-gray or white. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'It's pretty nice,' a comrade remarked, 'But it doesn't feel as good as home, really. If you look closely, the mountains feel stifling.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wang Fu’an didn't mind, 'There’s nothing special here, but the women are quite pretty.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Hmph, nonsense,' his comrade said with a laugh, shoving Wang Fu’an’s shoulder. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu At that moment, another comrade suddenly chimed in, 'Still, I seem to remember, this place used to be ours.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Well, that one sentence was enough to dampen their previously good mood, but what could they do about it? The truth was that it wasn't just China that was impoverished and weak, but the Soviet Union as well. These brothers in misfortune couldn't afford to look down on each other. Besides, the Soviets were still willing to do their best to host their Chinese comrades, which was quite something... \n\n£gezifu £gezifu No matter how you argued, a bad mood was still a bad mood. That day, the group bought a few things and returned early. As Wang Fu’an left the city, he stared intently at the city gradually receding in the sunset, clenched his fists, and sighed.

Mao Anying extended his hand, pointing to a roundabout route. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Maybe.' Vasilevsky nodded, 'Altay is currently controlled by a farmers' commune. The Red Army often provides them with protection in exchange for agricultural products. But the road there isn’t easy...

Thank you for your kindness, but we will leave tomorrow,' Mao Anying said firmly. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Make sure to take this with you,' seeing that Mao Anying had made up his mind, Vasilevsky didn’t try to dissuade him.

I can't remember; ever since we left Buryatia, we've been busy every step of the way, and writing the daily logs for the regiment has been trouble enough, leaving no time to open this notebook.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Since we set off from Tuva, we've been trekking for about a week and finally arrived in Altai.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The journey was not peaceful. Although the old roads were poorly maintained, they were still much easier to navigate than the meadows between Buryatia and Tuva. The real difficulty lay in the bandits along the way. Their scattered attacks with primitive weapons couldn't stand against our well-trained troops, but their cunning and ruthlessness far exceeded our expectations. Realizing they couldn't confront us directly, the bandits disguised themselves as local villagers and set ambushes, targeting our scouting units. Fortunately, I noticed the trap in time, preventing the scouts from being wiped out. In the skirmishes, a few soldiers only suffered minor injuries. We continued marching while seeking help from the locals.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu This afternoon, a messenger brought us good news; there’s a fairly large town nearby.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu When we arrived, the locals did not seem very welcoming. A well-known local priest came forward to greet us on their behalf. According to him, because the soldiers of the 88th Brigade were dusty and travel-worn, some people mistook them for bandits coming to attack the town, hence the caution. But after seeing Vasilevsky's handwritten letter, he was convinced that we weren't bandits and agreed to provide some necessary food and supplies for the Chinese Brigade, with the wounded being treated by local doctors.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Thank heavens, it seems that this old priest and the local residents are sympathetic to the communists, which has solved many of our problems. But we still didn't want to disturb the locals too much, so we set up camp at a location along the river, a bit away from the town..."

Although our supplies were not plentiful, with no wine or meat, just the bread we exchanged from the locals during the day and water from a nearby stream, the soldiers' spirits were still high. They gathered around and began to sing.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The Sacred War,' 'Song of the Plains Cavalry'... The soldiers sang old Soviet military songs, and the fatigue from days of marching was swept away by the powerful singing. Just as the atmosphere reached its peak, a sentry brought me bad news: a group of locals was approaching our camp... and they were carrying baskets filled with bottles! He feared they might be Molotov cocktails...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu I was stunned. Although the locals weren't overly hospitable during the day, they still treated our troops as well as they could. Was it all just a facade? Without thinking further, I went out with the sentry. Nothing could go wrong on our last night in Altai...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu It turned out that the leader was Father Alexander, and what they were carrying were not Molotov cocktails but genuine fine wines. They had heard the soldiers singing and followed the sound to discover that we were having a gathering. But when the old priest saw the water bottles and black bread in our hands, he frowned—\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'How can you have a proper feast without good wine?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'But we’ve already taken enough from you...' the sentry said, embarrassed.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Child...' The priest's large beard twitched, and only later did I realize he was trying to smile. 'We have good wine, but no reason to drink it. Take this and drink it; the water and soil of Russia will flow into your body and soul. No matter where you are, God will protect you...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu I brought them into the camp, and the priest called over some strong young men who had brought a cartload of fine wines and smoked meats. The soldiers were already singing passionately, and with the locals joining in, the atmosphere soared even higher. Everyone ate the smoked meats, downed the wine, and the soldiers bragged about their battles, pulling out their old sidearms, making the young farmers' eyes widen with awe! As the company commander, I sternly put a stop to this behavior. The old priest stood by, laughing heartily."

As the wine flowed, I couldn't help but sing 'The Hawthorn Tree.' The alcohol made my voice a little off-key, but who cared? Halfway through the song, I thought of A-Hong from my hometown... We used to play hide-and-seek by the tree at the village entrance when we were kids. After all these years, while I've wandered in a foreign land, has she married and settled down?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu That last night in Russia seemed longer than the ten years I had wasted here. With the burning alcohol, everyone swallowed their bitter tears, not thinking about when tomorrow would come, and simply got lost in the present...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The old priest drank sparingly, seemingly wary of staining his beard. Holding a rosary with a cross, he sat in a corner of the camp. Fueled by the alcohol, I approached him and said, 'We’re returning to our homeland tomorrow... It will be a harsh battle, and many of us will be buried on the battlefield... Even if we survive tomorrow, we will surely spill blood on some battlefield to save our nation... That’s why I allow them to drink...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, drink...' Turning the rosary in his hand, the priest smiled through his beard and said, 'When you fight for the fate of the poor, you are His soldiers. When you sacrifice for His cause, you will ascend to heaven.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Putting down the rosary, the old priest raised a bowl of strong liquor and clinked it with mine."

Whether it was the joyous atmosphere from last night carrying over to today, when we left Russia, I felt a sense of reluctance and attachment. Despite the turmoil and devastation here, I had come to see it as a second home. I hope that when we return, this place will once again flourish with revolutionary spirit.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu We all know that the road ahead will be filled with countless difficulties and obstacles, and we are already prepared to make sacrifices.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After learning of our departure, many locals, led by Father Alexander, came to send us off.

Although I don’t believe in God, at this moment, I too hope that some unseen force will bless us to reach our homeland safely.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After the ceremony ended, we left the peaceful town. After traveling south for three or four days, we arrived at the border of our homeland.

 COX.1.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Lenin long ago pointed out that a vanguard is an essential component of a successful proletarian revolution. After the liberation of Dihua, the immediate task was to rebuild the fragmented Communist Party of China and establish a provisional government for the base area. Fortunately, many comrades from the Xinjiang Bureau had experience working in government departments, so most positions were quickly filled, except for the position of Party Chairman, which remained undecided. After intense discussion, the selection narrowed down to four individuals—\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The first three candidates were all from the Xinjiang Bureau or at least local communists: Chen Tanqiu—a delegate to the First Congress of the Communist Party of China, who had been fighting on the frontlines since 1920, dedicating most of his life to the socialist revolution; Ahmetjan Qasimi—the founder of the New Alliance, whose studies in the Soviet Union made him a staunch Marxist, and as a Uyghur, he was determined to bring liberation to his people; Liu Shaoqi—a former senior cadre of the CCP, enjoying great prestige not only in the Xinjiang Bureau but throughout China; and Mao Anying, who led the 88th Guards Brigade to fire the first shots in the liberation of Xinjiang.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The meeting lasted late into the night, and to everyone's surprise, Chen Tanqiu eventually nominated Mao Anying. Not only was this unexpected by others, but Mao Anying himself could hardly believe the result.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I really don't understand, Elder, I haven’t worked domestically, while others have devoted themselves to the survival of the organization. I’m just a brigade commander who fought in Russia...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes...' Chen Tanqiu sighed after hearing Mao Anying’s doubts. With his eyes closed, he seemed to return to the Red Boat on Nanhu Lake forty years ago. Of the dozen or so young men who were then full of youthful vigor, few had survived, and perhaps he was the only one who had remained steadfast in his ideals. 'We old men can’t hold on much longer; the future will belong to you young people. Isn’t the new socialist state in Russia also being led by a young man now?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'But I have no experience and don’t know much about the specific situation in Xinjiang...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Lack of experience is actually a good thing.' Following Mao Anying's words, Chen Tanqiu recalled the early years of the struggle. Back then, which revolutionary wasn’t well-read and knowledgeable? But scholarly eloquence ultimately couldn’t convince the masses, and grand speeches were merely self-congratulatory. Only those who truly lowered themselves, conducted field investigations, and connected with the reality of China’s impoverished soil could make the lofty theories take root and bear the fruits of revolution. 'Communists do not believe in any established theories; all past experiences are ultimately in the past and have become history. Everything must start anew, and we old men may not live to see the day of victory...' "

Our uprising was swift and decisive, and Sheng Shicai could never have predicted the uprising in Altai, let alone mobilize troops in time to defend it. We should seize this opportunity and act quickly.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Although Sheng Shicai’s dictatorship has lasted for decades, his rule is not solid, and the vast rural areas of Xinjiang are not actually under his control.

Orders rarely reached outside Dihua, and the various ethnic minorities did not welcome this 'King of Xinjiang' from the Northeast. The landlords continued to run their own little kingdoms, sneering at the so-called authority of Sheng Shicai. The evidence of his failed rule is the radio station now standing in Dihua, where few people bother to listen.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu For a warlord content to rule in his small corner, Xinjiang’s current situation might be barely tolerable, but for the Chinese Brigade, who sought to use it as a base for liberating the entire country, this state of affairs had to be changed. The people of Xinjiang must be organized to break the chains that bind them and overthrow the oppressors who have always sat on their heads.

The key to surviving in chaotic times was to keenly sense the situation, discard what’s unimportant, and align oneself with the winning side in time.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu It was with this creed that Sheng Shicai managed to carve out a stable (as far as warlords go) rule in Xinjiang for decades amid chaos. The once menacing Soviet Union in the north had fallen to pieces, and the Central Government in the south, once full of pride, had become a puppet of the Japanese. Sheng Shicai's rule, however, had never been more secure. The powerful Japanese army had no interest in invading the worthless Xinjiang, and the warlords roaming the Soviet territory posed no real threat. The only threat came from within, but neither the Kuomintang nor the Communists were strong enough to stir up any trouble.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Sheng Shicai thought he could live out his days peacefully as the 'local emperor' in Dihua, but he never imagined that a 'bandit' force from the Mongolian Plateau would dare to invade Xinjiang's borders. Even more unimaginable was that this bandit force would drive his own loyal troops, the backbone of his decades-long rule, back to Dihua.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You’re all useless! Didn’t I spend a fortune to raise you lot?' Sheng Shicai shouted hysterically at the staff officer before him in the little villa he had carefully prepared for his old age. Faintly, he could hear the booming artillery fire and the intermittent sounds of light weapons, which only made the old man more irritable and uneasy.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Governor, you must retreat quickly.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Retreat? Are you suggesting I abandon all the citizens of Dihua and flee in disgrace?' Though he said this, he had already prepared his escape route. If Dihua fell, Sheng Shicai's rule in Xinjiang would effectively be over. Fortunately, he had already secured approval from the Japanese, and as long as he fled to the Republic of China, he could secure a position as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. So, after ordering his staff to 'defend Dihua to the death and not surrender the city to the enemy,' he packed his belongings and prepared to flee.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Don't move!' Just as Sheng Shicai was about to get into his Japanese car, a sudden shout came from behind him, and he felt the cold steel of a rifle against his back.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Hero... Please... Please don't act rashly.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Sheng Shicai, you old dog, do you remember who I am?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'We have no personal grudge between us; you can have Xinjiang. But could you please show some mercy and spare a humble man like me?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Don’t play dumb. You had no mercy when you killed my comrades ten years ago.' Feeling the rifle press harder against his back, Sheng Shicai straightened his back in fear (quite a feat for an old man). 'I’ve wanted to kill you for a long time.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Spare...

During this long week, they hadn’t wasted a moment, digging in their roots in Dihua—they had reorganized Sheng Shicai’s remnants, absorbed many new cadres, and reestablished grassroots organizations.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But this was far from enough. Just like in other parts of China, the majority of Xinjiang’s population consisted of farmers and herders living in the countryside, not cities. They had suffered greatly under oppression but knew nothing of the path to liberation, living in places beyond the reach of radio waves. This meant that work in Xinjiang could not, like some political commissar, be done merely through impassioned speeches over the radio to stir up a sweeping revolution.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The people of Xinjiang had been bound for too long, as if they had fallen into a deep darkness, with no opportunity even to imagine a different world. The real solution was to go to these people, visit them home by home, and show them the path to liberation, telling them—'A better world is possible.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ——Just as the old Communists did in Gannan and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu With this in mind, Mao Anying told the telegraph operator: 'Send a telegram to all regiments, telling them to study the articles "How to Analyze Rural Classes" and "Care for the Masses' Lives, Pay Attention to Working Methods" overnight, along with "Oppose Book Worship."

And at that time, where were the masses? Why didn’t they come to support us?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Anying paused, scanning the audience.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The soldiers’ spirits were heavy, many pondering deeply but still unable to grasp the answer.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Commander!' Suddenly, a hoarse voice came from the crowd, 'Comrade Zhao... Comrade Zhao died unjustly! He was harmed by those old peasants! They surrounded him, kicking and punching... There wasn’t a single piece of good flesh left on his body...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes.' Anying sighed, 'He was a good comrade. From Shaanbei to West Russia, he was always chanting my name when he found the brigade headquarters, and after becoming my bodyguard, he never fell behind... It’s the Central’s strategy that was flawed, causing such a good comrade to die at the hands of the reactionaries in vain. I’m here to make a public self-criticism! From now on, if the Central's directives lead to any problems in practice, comrades should boldly point them out so that good comrades like him do not die in vain...' 'The masses not supporting us proves that we haven’t done a good job in mass work. A Communist Party that doesn’t know how to conduct mass movements is bound to fail. Yagoda’s NKVD only knew repression, which is why they were defeated by Sablin. We are the same—when we were in Yan’an, the masses were our eyes, our hands, and feet, our lifeline. Without their support, the Central Committee couldn’t have survived in Shaanbei for even a year. But now, the masses in Xinjiang have not been mobilized; they are still working for the landlords who oppress them. Don’t assume that the masses understand their oppression and that all you have to do is raise your arms with passion, and they’ll follow you. It doesn’t work like that. Comrades must integrate with the masses, patiently work with them, and help them understand why they are oppressed. The comrades in 1st Battalion, 3rd Company, did a great job—they disguised themselves as passing merchants and bought the peasants’ grain at high prices. Meanwhile, a comrade who knew a bit of Uyghur kept asking the peasants—"Who feeds whom?" This alarmed the local lord, who called his retainers to disperse the crowd, but the masses protected our comrades in the middle, and no one dared to act.

The rural areas in Xinjiang were highly uneven in development and could be broadly classified into three categories: The first type of rural areas were near cities, had ample water supply, and relatively developed commodity economies. In these areas, a form of land rent similar to that in the Central Plains prevailed, with land highly concentrated in the hands of landlords, but serfdom had already disappeared. Such villages were a minority in Xinjiang. Most villages fell into the second category, where commodity economies had emerged, but due to limited water and transportation, serfdom still effectively existed. Landlords exploited peasants through both land rent in kind and heavy labor rent. The third type of rural areas were few in number and located in regions extremely lacking in water. Here, a complete form of serfdom was practiced, with serfs entirely dependent on their masters and suffering inhumane treatment. But all rural areas had one thing in common—the living conditions of the working people were always in stark contrast to those in power.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu According to comrades stationed in the villages, serfs lived in broken houses made of wicker, with at most a window in the roof for light. A typical serf family’s entire wealth consisted of no more than a couple of wooden bowls and a simple tool resembling a hoe. On the other hand, landlords lived in luxurious villas, served by at least ten serfs for their daily needs. In some wealthy areas, landlords even lived in Western-style buildings and drove Western cars. Landlords’ lands were farmed by serfs, fertile and productive, while the serfs' lands were often difficult to cultivate wastelands. Moreover, over half of the labor force was taken by landlords, severely dampening their productivity, and the annual harvest often wasn’t enough to feed their families for half a year.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Besides serfdom, the biggest issue was water supply. Across Xinjiang, only villages near the Tianshan Mountains could divert snowmelt for irrigation; the rest of the region was severely water-scarce. Making matters worse, since the time of the Republic of China, Xinjiang’s landlords had colluded with those in power to control the local water facilities. They used water as another tool to oppress peasants, arbitrarily withholding it, causing large areas of land to go barren. They also passed the taxes levied by the authorities for water projects entirely onto the peasants, resulting in heavy taxation with little to show for it—the so-called 'Ethnic Canal' in Yecheng County, a simple project, had been under construction for decades and was still unfinished.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The Imams were also a major problem. The Uyghur population was almost entirely Muslim, and religious devotion had given rise to a large class of non-productive clergy. These clerics, in collusion with landlords, burdened the peasants with heavy religious taxes, and even the Waqf lands meant for public use had largely fallen into the hands of landlords and Imams.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As the new sun shone into the office, Mao Anying had finished reading the report. Without time to rest, he had to head to the brigade headquarters for a meeting. Before the meeting, he wrote down three words in his notebook—"

 COX.23.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Upon arriving at Xiahelek Village, the first sight was a grove of tall poplar trees, always standing next to a deep courtyard. Beside it was a mosque exclusively for the use of the serf owner, surrounded by warehouses and various handicraft workshops. Beyond that were the shabby houses where the serfs and servants lived, built alongside the foul-smelling livestock pens.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The people living in the grand house called themselves Khojas, which means 'Holy Lineage'; they claimed to be 'White Bone Nobles,' descendants of the Prophet Muhammad. They held life and death power over this land and its people.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu For a thousand years, the serfs labored from dawn till dusk, without rest. Only after the Chinese brigade arrived did they win some leisure with their rifles; the serfs were allowed to gather in the small square at noon. Although this leisure was only half an hour, the Khojas still sent their thugs daily to disrupt it. As a result, the seven soldiers stationed in the village had to stand guard, armed, at the square's entrance, ensuring that today's meeting could proceed smoothly.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'When the Prophet journeyed east, he reached this place, where the ancestors of the Khojas went to meet him. The Prophet then used his power to have them plant a staff by the river, which quickly took root and sprouted into this great poplar... They are the chosen of Allah, followers of the Prophet; how could we possibly defy them?' In the cramped square at the village entrance, the serfs sat together, listening to the old serf Sima Yi speak.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Why can’t we defy them?' The young man Tursun Aiti suddenly stood up, 'Think about it, everyone; haven’t we been working their private land? Tending their horses, watching their shops, fetching their water, baking their bread, cutting their wood... What could their Mai Mai Ti Li Khan do without us? In winter, when he’s cold, we chop up our own furniture to send him firewood; at night, when he goes to the toilet, he needs two people to support him... Without our hard work, he couldn’t even empty his chamber pot!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You... You're really bewitched by the devil, aren’t you afraid of going to hell?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The square fell silent instantly. The serfs all turned their eyes toward the young man who had stood up, waiting for his response. Tursun Aiti hesitated, but the Red Army soldier standing beside him gave him an encouraging look, giving him the courage to continue speaking.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'If anyone’s going to hell, it won’t be us poor people! Ten years ago, my older brother was conscripted to build the great house for Mai Mai Ti Li Khan, dragging stones from ten miles away on the riverbank! He worked all day without rest, and still got whipped, coming home with his back too stiff to straighten up. Our family’s whole livelihood depended on an old plow ox, but it was taken away by Mai Mai Ti Li Khan and never returned in twelve years... Mai Mai Ti Li Khan has committed every evil under the sun, he doesn’t fear hell, why should I? Fellow villagers! In the past, the soldiers all sided with the Khojas, but now it’s different. The Red Army is here to liberate us poor people! Speak out about your grievances, tell everyone about the hardships you’ve suffered!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Tursun Aiti raised his calloused right hand, and gradually, other hands raised as well—weathered hands, frail hands, strong hands browned by the sun—one by one, the hands of the working people were raised. They stepped into the center of the square, beneath the ancient poplar tree, and began their bitter complaints in a flood of emotion."

As Comrade Zhang said, after developing a few activists, the previously timid atmosphere had disappeared. The suffering serfs, having realized their power, stood up one after another to tell us about the inhumane treatment they had endured.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Tuti (younger brother of Ahmet, Mai Mai Ti Li Khan's personal servant): My brother was sold to the Khojas as a child to serve as a servant. Mai Mai Ti Li Khan would beat and scold him whenever he was in a bad mood, never treating him as a human being. One day, when Mai Mai Ti Li Khan’s sister had an affair with a non-Khoja, my brother was beaten and scolded for not reporting it. Just because he mumbled, 'I don’t know,' he was hung upside down for three days and nights, his mouth bleeding the whole time. When they finally took him down, he was dead. Killing a cow would be a big decision, but killing a person was done casually!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Tursun Aiti (fourth-generation serf): For twenty years, after every morning prayer, I had to greet the Khojas, but one day I didn’t because I was looking for a cow. By noon, I was called over and beaten until my face swelled up, then I had to keep working in the afternoon.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Hasmu (rebellious serf): I couldn’t stand seeing Mai Mai Ti Li Khan's rampant behavior, so I was taken to the great house. Every door I passed through was locked behind me until I reached the sixth door. Then they hung me from a beam and beat me until all ten of my toenails came off, and my legs were skinned and bleeding. After that, they threw me into the donkey pen. He often climbed up to the summer pavilion to curse us: 'Mice want to die by running to the cat. Let’s see who’s tougher. I’m a rock, and you’re walnuts. Whenever I want to eat, I’ll smash you. Whoever opposes me, I’ll kill.' He was worse than a vulture.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After hearing about the villagers’ experiences, I was filled with anger. Although we didn’t speak the same language, when they talked about how the landlords oppressed them, we felt a deep connection. This afternoon, we went to confiscate Mai Mai Ti Li Khan’s court and prison. Looking at the blood-stained torture tools, I couldn’t help but want to skin him alive, but remembering how cooperative he had been, we just sealed the torture tools, dismissed his retainers, and left it at that.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But I’m sure that Mai Mai Ti Li Khan, who has done so much evil, won’t escape the people’s judgment."

 COX.25.d:"£gezifu £gezifu In Xiahelek Village, Mai Mai Ti Li Khan and the Khojas were the absolute rulers. However, their family history wasn’t as long as they claimed. When the veil of legend was lifted, their rise was as dishonorable as any other landlord's—in fact, sixty years ago, the 1,700 mu of land here belonged to another Khoja named Amir Khan. But later, while Amir Khan was on a pilgrimage to Mecca, Mai Mai Ti Li Khan’s grandfather conspired with the local government to seize the vast lands. Since then, whether under the Qing Emperor, the Republic of China, Sheng Shicai, or the Japanese, nothing could shake the absolute power of their family.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu So when he received a message from Dihua claiming to be from the Chinese brigade, he didn’t pay much attention. He knew that since ancient times, those in power hadn’t been able to touch people like them. So he switched the channel, rolled over, and casually ordered his servant to massage his feet harder.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu At that time, he never imagined that just a few months later, the serfs who had once bowed to him would overthrow his rule. He, who was now comfortably eating fruits, would soon be standing in fear before the gallows.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Mai Mai Ti Li Khan, the People’s Court is now announcing your sentence.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Tursun Aiti’s loud voice pulled him from his proud memories back to reality. 'Only Allah can judge me, where did you get the authority?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You scoundrel, how dare you mention Allah?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Go to hell!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The crowd below burst into chaos. The liberated serfs waved their fists, their spittle flying, and occasionally a stone would fly toward the stage.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Fellow villagers, calm down.' It took Tursun Aiti a while to quiet the crowd’s anger before he continued, 'The People’s Court’s authority is given by the people. The people created everything you eat, wear, and live with, so they naturally have the authority to judge you! You are charged with multiple counts of murder, abuse of private justice, and withholding wages. You also refused to cooperate with the People’s Government, with a very bad attitude. The People’s Court hereby sentences you to death, to be executed immediately!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As soon as he finished speaking, two armed Chinese brigade soldiers standing beside Mai Mai Ti Li Khan escorted him to the gallows. Looking up through the sturdy wooden beams, the sunlight flickering through the poplar leaves, he realized this was the place where he had often lounged for shade. Now, it was the place of his death.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Prisoner, do you have any last words?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Tursun Aiti, you’ve really risen up, haven’t you?' Mai Mai Ti Li Khan turned his head to look at the village committee secretary, who stood confidently on the platform. 'By sucking up to the officials, are you hoping to take my place as Khoja?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Serfdom has been abolished. Everyone now has their own land, and we will build a beautiful new life together. But in this new life, there is no place for exploiters like you!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Had the times really changed?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Before Mai Mai Ti Li Khan's breath stopped, he thought about this.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The Khoja’s body was initially planned to hang for a whole day, but after half a day, it had been so defiled that it was unrecognizable. The People’s Committee then hurriedly decided to bury it, placing it in the Gobi Desert outside the village, marking the grave hastily with a circle of small stones, just as he had treated the serfs who had died miserably."

 COX.26.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Kuqa County’s Halka Village is the most water-scarce village in southern Xinjiang. Although we already knew the water situation here was dire, the reality we encountered when our squad arrived was beyond miserable—outside the village, crooked stalks of wheat and maize struggled to grow in the yellow sandy soil, with weeds growing more vigorously than the main crops. Inside the village, the ground was littered with bodies, and it was hard to tell if they were dead or alive.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'There’s no water, not a drop; how can we farm?' Old farmer Tayir, nearly 70 years old, still worked the fields, but now he could only sit on the edge of a field, sighing. 'The whole village has only one (Karez well), and it’s all his (Ayiti Pasha and Khoja’s). I signed an agreement with him—I work for him, and he gives me three mu of land, but he gives the land without the water. (People say) if you give something good, if you offer something valuable, you’ll get some water. My family gave him a cow, gave him my daughter, and now all that’s left are these old bones and a hoe. What am I supposed to do?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu I took out the cornbread I had brought as rations and handed it to the old man, while a young man in our team who spoke Uyghur told him our purpose.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His pupils dilated in disbelief, looking at my face, then at the rifles slung at our waists, and finally, he turned his head to the sky, murmuring, 'Allah...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Following his gaze, I looked up at the sky too. For a hundred years, it had hardly rained here, and even clouds rarely drifted by. I thought, even in such an environment, people have survived, with their diligent hands, creating an oasis in this vast desert. With the power to overturn everything already in the hands of the working people who created all this, why should they still pray to the heavens? I pulled the old man to his feet, and he seemed to understand my meaning. He reached out his trembling hand, pointing to the swaying shadow not far away, surrounded by poplars.

No matter how much water there was, his fields always had the best harvests in the village. He even built his grand house next to the channel, not just for convenient access to water for daily use but also for the scenic view—after breakfast, Safedin would always sit leisurely in his rocking chair under the poplar tree, fanning himself, watching the flowing stream in the channel, and gazing at the serfs working on the opposite bank. What a picturesque pastoral scene!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But now, the villagers were gathered at the gate of Safedin’s large courtyard, clamoring to divide up the high-yielding fields near the village entrance.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You savages, robbers, do you think you can just take whatever you want? Is there no law, no morality left?' The woman who was now cursing was none other than Safedin’s wife.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'These lands have been in my family for generations. You have no deeds, no arbitration, so how can you just take them?' After the crowd had been noisy for almost the entire morning, the newly awakened Safedin finally walked out of the house. 'We are all reasonable people; I’ve already nullified everyone’s deeds, redistributed the land, and provided tools where they were lacking. My family is now down to just seven or eight people with only a dozen mu of land. What more do you want?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Without water, our crops will all die of thirst.' The leader, Rehemai, said, 'Now the water is only just enough to irrigate your land. It wasn’t like this last year.

The checkpoint outside the village has long been removed, and it was removed under the supervision of the Chinese brigade. Now it’s purely nature’s fault. The channel just has less water this year. Even if you ransack my house, you won’t get any more water!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Bullshit! You’ve done this before. You opened a channel next to my field, forcing us to stop farming, and then bought our land at a low price!' A village woman shouted.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You also released those oxen to trample our fields!' Another villager added, 'Half of the year’s harvest was ruined, and we had no choice but to sell the land to you for food!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'When I was irrigating my field, your lackeys always looked at their watches, saying the irrigation time was the same, but they always gave your land more water and ours less.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Fellow villagers, this beast in human form has committed countless evils in the past! We are liberated now, and we demand justice!' Rehemai shouted loudly. 'If you don’t remove the checkpoint now, then give us the few mu of irrigated land!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'This...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Seeing him hesitate, all the past oppression turned into overwhelming anger.

And another: 'When Allah is merciful, ten fields will be half barren; when Allah is angry, nine out of ten fields will be barren.' Year after year, the landlords were only concerned with collecting water rent, always thinking about how to raise the price of water higher than the price of grain. They neglected the Karez wells in the village, which gradually fell into disrepair, and now they are paying the price—more than half of the village's land has become completely barren and unusable, while the remaining half can barely maintain a meager yield through crop rotation.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The situation is very grim.

The report just now was not exaggerated; even after liberation, the village's situation continued to deteriorate. The farmers lacked tools and fertilizers, and the most crucial water source was dwindling by the day. The village's food reserves were nearly depleted. If there isn't a good harvest next season, they may have no choice but to evacuate the villagers. The most urgent task is to solve the water problem, but the village's Karez well was built by the previous generation. Now, there is almost no one left who participated in its construction, and without understanding its exact structure, modifying the well is extremely difficult. If the flow is accidentally cut off, the consequences would be disastrous...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Squad leader, the villagers outside say they want to see the soldiers.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'What do they want?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The old man leading them said he went down the well once when he was a child and wants to try going down again.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Great!' Chen Gonghong picked up the freshly printed telegram on the table and walked quickly to the door. 'Where are the villagers now?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'They’re all over by the open channel!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu According to Tayir, who once participated in the Karez well inspection, the well consists of an open channel above ground and an underground channel. For an entire generation, inspections of the open and underground channels had ceased. It wasn't until after liberation that the villagers voluntarily formed a water protection team, patrolling the open channels to prevent water theft and checking for any leaks.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The villagers have done their utmost to patch up all the leaks in the open channel,' Chen Gonghong said, 'But the water flow is still severely insufficient, so we must go down to the underground channel to investigate.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'When it was built, there were passages for people to enter, and the route wasn’t complicated...at least it wasn’t back then. We used to go down every fifteen days to clear out the silt, but so much time has passed, who knows what the well looks like now.' As he spoke, Elder Tayir took out a yellowed piece of paper. 'This is a map of the maintenance route left by my father. Take it.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu With the hopes of the old man and the villagers, the repair team set out.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu All the able-bodied young people in the village, led by the Chinese brigade soldiers stationed there, followed the trickling water stream, heading toward the ancient mountains, searching for traces of the great achievements of the laboring people who fought against heaven and earth.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The search lasted all day. Under the scorching sun, they trudged through the blistering white sand and strange rocky hills, careful not to miss any potentially usable entrance. As the sun was about to set, they finally found an entrance to the underground channel. Just as Elder Tayir had estimated, the channel was filled with collapsed sections and rubble. Although the water flow hadn't been cut off, only a small trickle silently flowed through the narrow, confined channel.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu This was destined to be an extremely arduous task, yet it was a matter of life and death. Regardless of age, wealth, or status, everyone in the village joined in this race against time. The city of Dihua sent a few trucks to help transport the soil. On the second day of the emergency repairs, they set up makeshift shelters near the well entrance. That evening, the village women brought iron pots and cooked cornbread, and for the next week, the clinking and clanking of well repairs never ceased.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Ten days after the work began, the village's dry open channel was filled with clear water for the first time in decades..."

Behind him were bold red characters: 'Strive for Speed, Quality, and Savings, Full Power to Production' and 'Build a New Era Democratic Agricultural Association Organization.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The little soldier had successfully completed the task assigned to him by the Propaganda Command, but what he didn’t know was that from Aksu in the west to Hami in the east, nearly all the agricultural associations in Xinjiang had completed their first phase of historical missions—fighting landlords and dividing the land. Countless grassroots Red Army soldiers traveled through villages large and small, actively engaging with the broad masses of farmers, and the initial reforms of the agricultural associations were completed in the shortest time possible. The focus of the agricultural associations was no longer the public trials of landlords and the liberation of farmers and serfs, but rather, they had transformed into village organizations providing conveniences to the broad masses of farmers and accelerating production.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The old soldier who went to Aksu's villages to carry out the agricultural association reforms confidently walked down from the village's earthen walls, having just delivered an inspiring speech there. From the clear and satisfied looks in the farmers' eyes, he keenly realized that after fighting against the landlords and gaining their own land, they were now more inclined to devote themselves entirely to production.

 #COX.34.d:"£gezifu £gezifu “同志们，针对目前西北地区的形势，我同意刘少奇同志关于主要矛盾的发言。”岸英从座位上站起来，瞬间成为全场的焦点。“但是我还是有些不同意见的。我们不要忽视一点，就是布里亚特是直接暴露在日本人枪口底下的。对于他们来说，德国人很远，但日本法西斯却很近。而且帝国主义者认识到布里亚特是我们的战略后方，不牢牢控制住贝加尔湖周边他们就没法击败我们。所以说，东西伯利亚的主要矛盾逐渐转变为当地人民与日本帝国主义的矛盾，随着东西伯利亚的解放，这一点会更加明显。”岸英把讲稿轻轻地放在一边，抬起头，语气愈发坚定有力。\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “俄国亚洲部分的局势就像我们的土地革命时期一样，较少的红区，和白区内的大小军阀并存。目前阶级矛盾还是占主要地位，但随着日本帝国逐步向北扩张自己的殖民地，并决心镇压俄国的萨布林主义者，以巩固自己的统治。在布里亚特和中亚，一场艰难的战争将会发生。我相信萨布林同志是懂得这个道理的，因为他是个坚定的马克思主义者。而马家军，他是有投机性的，他可以搞个投降，摇身一变成个小军头。“联虏平寇”才是这些人的真实面目……再说了，无论我们要不要去和他们搞联合，帝国主义和军阀的战争毕竟已经打起来了。不去搞联盟，他们打着；去搞联盟，他们还是打着，相对地我们一定程度上反而被马家军牵着走了。所以说，很多同志还是被之前的边界线给限制住了思维，而忽视了最基本的矛盾分析。”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 会堂中沉闷的空气似乎被这个中年人散发出的力量驱散。窗外，新疆特有的狂风裹挟沙石，剧烈地冲击着那些千年一面的土坯建筑，蒙古高原上的高压鼓动气流浩荡南下，将笼罩于西域大地上的高温气团撕裂、驱逐……一场滋润万物的大雨应该就会在沙暴之后来临。\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人，这是革命的首要问题。联合进步的俄国同志。与辻政信战斗期间暂时避免与马家军作战。战后，我们仍然要解放青海的人民。而不能因为一个什么“统一战线”而自缚手脚……因此我建议‘联俄抗日，徐图青海’。”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 岸英的意见受到了红区派的广泛支持，部分白区派的同志也转为赞同这个意见。但是很多刚刚入党的迪化本土派同志比较反对，他们不希望刚刚和平的新疆立刻陷入战火之中。一些激进主义者也表示不赞同，对他们来说，向俄国人要求援助几乎必定会成为一场利益交易，而且很可能会付出巨大的代价——可能是经济上的，也可能是政治上的。而且越是危急的时刻，就越是要保持纯净性。对马家军的任何妥协，都是背叛。"

COX.36.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Liu An stood in line for the meal window, curiously looking around. Today was his first day of training in Dihua, and being arranged to dine in such a canteen made him feel both excited and thrilled. According to other comrades, this place used to be where Sheng Shicai's lackeys feasted and indulged. Although some of the overly luxurious decorations had been removed, the room was still filled with large ceramic vases, and the tables and chairs were all polished to a bright shine, almost as if they had been oiled. This old soldier from the northwest of Shanxi had never been in such a spacious and bright room before, and now he couldn’t help but grin from ear to ear.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade... Comrade?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Snapping out of it, Liu An realized he had somehow ended up at the front of the line. The comrade in charge of serving the food handed him a small wooden tray; the food wasn’t much different from what he was used to in the regular troops. Liu An quickly took the tray and stepped aside to make room for the comrades behind him.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu What a shame, to be dazzled by the luxuries of a reactionary warlord—Liu An cursed himself for his momentary weakness as he found an empty seat and sat down.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade Liu, good afternoon!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A burly Eastern European man enthusiastically greeted Liu An and sat down next to him.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Oh, oh, Comrade Parajonov...' Liu An was surprised to see someone he knew here, 'Good afternoon, good afternoon.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade Liu doesn’t seem very energetic today.' Parajonov carefully examined Liu An's face. This sturdy man had fought alongside the Chinese Brigade during the West Russia War and had picked up the habit of always being concerned about others' health. However, being stared at by a bearded face made Liu An a bit uneasy.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'It’s nothing, I’m just not used to such a fancy place,' Liu An said awkwardly, not wanting to admit the truth. Parajonov didn’t seem to mind—or perhaps he didn’t notice at all.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'No need to worry about that,' Parajonov said, patting Liu An on the back, 'In a few days, we’ll probably be heading to Kyzylorda.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Kyzylorda...?' Liu An thought the name sounded familiar, but he couldn’t figure out why they would be going there.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You didn’t know? Today’s Spark Report already mentioned it. The Kazakh Red Army has invited us to help them fight bandits!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Parajonov shook his head in exaggerated disbelief at Liu An’s ignorance, then pulled out a newspaper from somewhere and placed it on the table. The freshly printed paper still had a faint smell of ink. The headline read 'Kazakh Bandits Rampant, Revolutionary Comrades Join Forces' in large characters, followed by the full text of a letter signed by 'Comrade Baorjiang.' Liu An quickly skimmed through the letter, feeling his blood boil once more. Although he couldn’t understand why this was a reply letter, he knew that these villains would soon be eradicated from the earth by the Red Army.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'When are we leaving? Which companies will be deployed to Kazakhstan?' Liu An grabbed the newspaper, 'I need to report to Commander Mao immediately. I request to rejoin my unit at once!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Hey, calm down, calm down.' Parajonov pulled Liu An back as he tried to stand up, 'This time it’s just us and a small group of soldiers...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Us? You mean the group selected by Commander Mao? How can such a small group handle this?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Hey, let me finish. We’ll be leading a small unit in battle, but the Kazakh recruits will be following us, learning as they go, so don’t worry about not having enough men!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Liu An suddenly remembered that he had come to Dihua for training to become a squad leader. A wave of nervousness gripped him as he began to doubt whether he was capable of leading a unit effectively—a large hand was placed on his shoulder; it was Parajonov.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Don’t worry. We still have a few more days of training before we set out. Trust me, commanding is not as hard as you think.'"

COX.37.d:"£gezifu £gezifu 'Toot—Toot—Toot—Toot—' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The clear and loud wake-up call echoed over the barracks. Xu Guanglai lay in bed, tightly closing his eyes, but the sound still reached his uncovered ears, causing him great annoyance. In fact, Xu Guanglai had already been awake; years of military life had made his schedule extremely regular. But today, he just didn’t want to get out of bed.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Squad Leader Xu, it’s time for roll call...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Leave me alone, leave me alone... go, go.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Xu Guanglai grumbled, waving away the soldiers who were getting close. He couldn’t help but feel troubled—just yesterday, Commander Mao had given the order for him to leave the company early this morning to go to Dihua for training. Xu Guanglai had heard about the various troubles that had arisen with the surrendering troops and was willing to help ease the commander’s burden. But now that the time had come to leave, he found himself unable to move his legs. He pulled the quilt over his head, but he still heard the door close. His comrades should be heading to the washroom with their washbasins by now.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The quilt muffled the outside noise, and Xu Guanglai felt a sense of peace and comfort. He had tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep due to worry, and now he was starting to feel sleepy. Just as he was drifting off, the door was suddenly thrown open, the sound so loud it made him jump.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Xu Guanglai, what’s the matter with you?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The platoon leader’s loud voice approached, and Xu Guanglai quickly clutched the quilt tighter. Sure enough, the platoon leader started yanking at his covers. Although Xu Guanglai held on with all his might to keep the quilt from being taken away, lying down made it hard to exert force, and he was about to roll off the bed.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Thud—' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Xu Guanglai fell on his backside. Fortunately, the quilt cushioned the fall, so it didn’t hurt. He looked up to see the platoon leader glaring down at him.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You’ve got some strength... What’s the matter, you feel wronged to be sent to Dihua for training? Don’t want to go, so you’re not moving? Comrade Xu Guanglai, do you even have any sense of organizational discipline left?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Since he could no longer stay in bed, Xu Guanglai reluctantly got up and, half-walking, half-dragged by the platoon leader, got dressed, washed up, and then went to the mess hall. After quickly finishing his breakfast, a sullen Xu Guanglai was escorted by the platoon leader to the barracks' main gate, where the summoned soldiers were gathering and boarding the bus to Dihua.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Squad Leader Xu!' 'Squad Leader Xu!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The dejected Xu Guanglai heard his name being called. He looked up to see his fellow squad members standing by the roadside. When they noticed him looking their way, the group of young men started clapping and cheering for their old squad leader.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Xu Guanglai looked at his comrades, the familiar faces making his nose tingle with emotion.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Squad Leader Xu, don’t be sad. Commander Mao chose you to be a squad leader, so our squad can hold its head high.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Well, that’s true...' Xu Guanglai rubbed his eyes and adjusted his mood, 'I had planned to show you guys around when the unit finally reached my hometown, but now it seems that won’t happen... I’m really sorry, everyone...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Don’t worry about it, Squad Leader Xu. You’re too capable; you think the unit can do without you?' The youngest soldier grinned, 'We’ve heard so much about your hometown that our ears are getting calloused. When the unit gets there, we’ll come find you. I bet we won’t have any trouble!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'How can you say that?' Xu Guanglai feigned sternness, though this time it was a pretense, 'Lack of organization and discipline, running off to visit other units is unacceptable!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You’re the one who refused to go and had to be dragged here by the platoon leader, and you still have the nerve to talk!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The words made Xu Guanglai and his comrades burst into laughter. The bus bell rang, signaling the imminent departure. Xu Guanglai shook hands with his old comrades one by one and boarded the rumbling bus. The bright red sun was slowly rising over the Gobi Desert, shining warmly on Xu Guanglai. He had a vague feeling that something big awaited him in Dihua."

COX.38.t:"Sheng Shicai's Former Troops Brawl!"
COX.38.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying pulled down the brim of his hat, observing his surroundings with interest. At this moment, he looked like an ordinary company-level Chinese Brigade officer—in fact, before setting out, he had repeatedly checked his disguise in the mirror, and it seemed flawless. At least, up to now, no one had recognized him. Since the total number of troops was not large, the full review didn’t take long, and the old comrades who had watched the parade returned to Dihua to rest. However, Mao Anying still felt energetic. His disguise was for the purpose of secretly inspecting the barracks and observing the soldiers' training. Mao Anying knew that if he were recognized, the company would certainly stop their drills to salute him, so he was very careful along the way, even a bit sneaky. Fortunately, there were few people on the small road by the parade ground, so no one would mistake him for a bad element and report him to the Politburo. As he strolled along, he carefully observed the dynamics on the parade ground.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'One, two, one, yi er yi, yi er yi...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The soldiers in coarse military uniforms ran past him in neat formation, but their chanting was less than uniform. The serious expressions on the soldiers' faces and their odd pronunciation made Mao Anying chuckle. These soldiers belonged to the Chinese Brigade, many of whom were Kazakh, Russian, and Mongolian. Now, in addition to their daily training, they also attended evening classes in Chinese; to carry out the revolution on Chinese soil, they had to overcome the language barrier. Mao Anying watched as the Chinese Brigade’s formation gradually disappeared from sight. A new company entered his view—this unit was slightly less disciplined but maintained a decent formation, and their chanting was quite loud. As former soldiers of Sheng Shicai, their performance had greatly improved compared to when they first defected. Given time, perhaps these former warlord troops could also be transformed into a revolutionary army as determined as the Chinese Brigade. Mao Anying closed his eyes, as if he could already see the heroic posture of the red-flagged troops, invincible and triumphant, marching out from Xinjiang, sweeping away all reactionary warlords, and thoroughly expelling the Japanese invaders and their shameless puppets from Chinese soil...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Then, a sudden commotion on the parade ground interrupted his reverie.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying looked towards the source of the noise and saw two groups of men in a tense standoff in the middle of the field. He couldn’t tell if these soldiers had quarreled during a break or were deliberately planning a fight, but such an incident should never occur here. The arguing voices reached his ears:\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Old Chen, did you take my cigarettes or not?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You can’t get enough on your own, so you’re blaming me? If you’ve got guts, go rob the warehouse, then I’ll respect you as a real man!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I see you’re looking for a fight! Brothers, get him!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu At the leader's command, the two groups howled and started brawling. Mao Anying’s smile faded. He realized he had overlooked something very important—perhaps the cliques and small groups within the old army hadn’t disappeared, but merely gone into hiding. If the internal structure remained unchanged, then for these warlord troops, it was just a change of masters. No matter how well they were trained, without the consciousness of a revolutionary army, they would forever remain a bunch of undisciplined rabble.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A sharp whistle echoed above the parade ground. Several mounted instructors were already heading to the scene of the fight, trying to restrain the brawling soldiers. Mao Anying’s earlier good mood had vanished without a trace. As he watched this farce, a thought emerged in his mind: he needed to replace those unruly old officers with a new batch of commanders."

COX.39.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Defection, changing flags, and reorganization—this was Wang Fugui’s repetitive life. After news of Chairman Chiang’s death in Chongqing spread, the remaining National Revolutionary Army scattered like sand, and overnight, Wang Fugui lost his old unit. He could only rely on his sharpshooting skills to earn a living with various local warlords, drifting through years of constant change until he eventually became one of Sheng Shicai’s men. Then, another army came from the north. Wang Fugui resisted for a while before obediently surrendering.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Surrendering had become second nature to Wang Fugui, but the number of the unit that captured him still surprised him: these soldiers claimed to belong to the Chinese Brigade of the Red Army. The last time he had heard of the 'Red Army' was over twenty years ago, and it felt somewhat unreal. The Red Army treated him well, and after testing his marksmanship, they quickly integrated him into their ranks. Some of his old comrades would occasionally sneak over to play cards and drink with him, so overall, he had no reason to complain.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But now, he couldn’t sleep.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wang Fugui lay wide awake, staring at the dirt-colored ceiling. He couldn’t close his eyes—whenever he did, the tear-streaked face of an old Kazakh woman would appear before him. This happened about five or six days ago when he was following his unit on a mission in the Kyzylorda region. They were patrolling near a small village when they spotted dust rising from horses’ hooves. They pursued and found bandits looting the village. The squad leader ordered them to open fire. Wang Fugui aimed at what seemed to be the leader and shot him in the head. The remaining bandits dropped their saddlebags and fled but were all picked off by the Red Army and Kazakh troops. While they were clearing the battlefield, a trembling old woman approached Wang Fugui, holding his hand and saying many things he couldn’t understand. The interpreter told him that the bandits had taken all the village’s grain and that without the Red Army’s intervention, they wouldn’t have had enough to survive the winter. The woman was thanking him for killing the bandit leader. Wang Fugui listened in confusion. Until that day, no one had ever thanked him for killing someone—since then, the old woman’s face had been troubling him constantly.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu If—just if—if his shooting wasn’t merely about killing, but actually helping someone...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A light knock sounded on the door—it was his old comrades calling him out for a drink, but Wang Fugui didn’t respond. After the knocking stopped, he took out all his cigarettes from the drawer and smoked them one after another until he couldn’t stop coughing, then threw the rest out the window and went to sleep fully clothed.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The next day, Wang Fugui woke up early. He didn’t go to the mess hall but wandered aimlessly around the barracks until he was stopped by a door that suddenly appeared. He could still recognize a few words, knowing one of them was 'person,' and he suddenly knew what he needed to do. He pushed open the door and saw a clerk sitting behind a desk, looking at him inquisitively.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wang Fugui’s lips moved, and he spoke."

The anxious waiting made his hands sweat.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Finally, Mao Anying put down the document. He looked up and stared at the cadre who had returned from southern Xinjiang.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I’d like to ask, after clearly outlining the task of cracking down on the collection of land rent, why is it that some areas still have landlords collecting farmers’ production income?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Liu Mingli couldn’t answer this question. He was one of the few from Sheng Shicai’s government to be employed by the base area government and was unfamiliar with land reform work. Hearing Mao Anying’s question, sweat began to bead on his forehead, and he hurriedly pulled out a handkerchief to wipe it.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I think this should be an isolated case, Chairman. I personally inspected the grassroots, and most villages no longer require farmers to pay rent...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, it is indeed only a few stubborn landlords... but many more landlords are still watching.

After the sound of footsteps faded in the corridor, Mao Anying took out a sheet of draft paper from his drawer and lit a cigarette—he didn’t smoke, but the rising smoke inexplicably comforted him and helped him think. The problems in southern Xinjiang were obviously severe; the resistance of serf landlords to policies and continued rent collection might be more widespread than the report indicated.

 COX.43.d:"£gezifu £gezifu The law is an expression of the will of class rule—any Marxist would say that.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Of course, besides the laws enforced by the ruling class of a state, there are also laws within clans and temples, as they are significant organizations of social production and reproduction. These laws are maintained by a set of violent tools.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu These concepts might seem like principles from a simplified textbook, but they are, in fact, real issues. The Dihua People’s Court had been established for over three months, yet no one came to file a lawsuit. The courtroom was empty, the gavel silent, much like the current authority of the Soviet government’s laws.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu This embarrassing phenomenon indicated a fact: the laws of the Soviet government were being ignored. The reactionaries were still upholding their legal system, using private law to firmly grasp legal dominance in the base area.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu To address this issue, the Soviet Central Committee had to convene an emergency meeting. However, what started as a discussion soon turned into an angry denunciation by the party members. The heated 'discussion' lasted for four hours, finally summarized by the meeting’s host, Zhang Wentian.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu '...In short, the existence of private law is supported by the armed forces of clans and sects. If we want to enforce the laws of the Soviet government, we must destroy their armed forces and confiscate their guns.' Zhang Wentian wiped the sweat from his face. 'So, if there are no objections, let’s move on to nominating candidates to oversee this task...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrades, please wait a moment.' Wang Zhen, who had been silently listening to the debate, suddenly spoke. 'Executing the disarmament work requires significant armed forces, but currently, only the Political Security Bureau’s troops can be mobilized, which is far from enough... If we lack the capability to broadly enforce disarmament policies in southern Xinjiang, it’s better not to provoke the enemy pointlessly with overly aggressive actions.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying looked around the room at his comrades. Deep down, he supported the outcome of the discussion—why should workers, who strive to change the world with their own hands, be judged by reactionaries hiding behind religious banners? But at the same time, he couldn’t deny that Wang Zhen had a point; the risks were real, and their forces weren’t enough to handle a massive backlash from the reactionaries.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The committee members looked at him with eyes that were either eager or hesitant.

 COX.44.d:"£gezifu £gezifu At eight in the evening, the Soviet building was nearly empty except for the guards. But...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Chairman!' An urgent voice called out. A staff member, holding a letter, pushed open the office door. His head was covered in sweat, clearly indicating the importance of the matter.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying was not alone in the room; Chen Tanqiu and Chen Geng were there, with the latter smoking to relieve stress. Seeing the letter in the staff member’s hand, Chen Geng got up and took it.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade, an urgent letter from southern Xinjiang. Someone has attacked those who bravely reported to us.' He wiped his sweat with one hand while handing the letter to Chen Geng with the other. Chen Geng glanced at it briefly, and his expression immediately darkened. Without a word, he handed the letter to Mao Anying.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Speak slowly, don’t rush,' Mao Anying calmly took the letter, silently estimating the time: an urgent letter from southern Xinjiang to Dihua would have been sent around four this afternoon at the earliest, meaning the incident must have occurred within the past day.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying opened the letter, which contained only a few brief lines—the rioters in Kuqa County had seized the activists who had complained to the Soviet authorities, paraded them through the streets, and then beat them severely with soaked sticks. The local Soviet office was surrounded by the rioters, with dozens of militiamen desperately defending it. The religious affairs team sent to the area had all gone missing, their fates unknown.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying’s grip on the letter tightened, crumpling the edges. He had anticipated that the reactionaries would cause trouble, but he hadn’t expected that merely mobilizing the masses to voice grievances and exposing the symbiotic relationship between religious figures and the landlord class would provoke such a strong backlash.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Another set of hurried footsteps approached. A guard rushed in with a blood-stained letter, which Mao Anying immediately took without hesitation.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The religious affairs team fell into the hands of the rioters and was subjected to vigilante justice a little after four in the afternoon. Although their lives were spared, one was so severely injured that he might never stand again. The situation is critical; the central authorities must respond quickly.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying silently looked at the letter—another few good soldiers of the Chinese Brigade had been lost.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Chen Tanqiu, standing nearby, read the letter and then took a sip of water before slowly saying, 'The reactionary forces have bared their fangs once again. We’ve lost too many comrades in Xinjiang over the years...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Over the course of his long years of struggle, he had witnessed countless comrades sacrifice their lives. Yet, faced with such loss once more, he couldn’t help but feel a deep sadness.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Chen Geng picked up the letter and studied it carefully, then let out a cold snort.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'These damned reactionary bastards...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying tried to calm Chen Geng down.

 COX.45.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Zhou Youming wandered idly around the small village, clutching his notebook. The reason for his wandering was that he didn’t want to return to the workstation. Besides, the weather was nice; the afternoon sun was golden, and even the brick houses shaded by the distant green willows were exceptionally clear—that was the local Bek’s mansion.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Old bastard...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He cursed under his breath.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He couldn’t help but feel angry—it was this old man who was preventing him from going home. According to the usual practice, after returning to the workstation, the workgroup members would have to report the day’s progress. But today, Zhou Youming had nothing to show for his work. Looking at the scribbled notes on his paper, he scratched his thinning hair in frustration.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'No forced tenancy, no heavy rent... After paying taxes and providing for themselves, they even have surplus grain to sell.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu —What utter nonsense.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Zhou Youming didn’t know how things were elsewhere, but in the village he was responsible for, almost every household was a tenant farmer. As long as this dependent relationship existed, even if rent was reduced, the Beks would always find other ways to squeeze money from the tenants. There were many ways to do this, such as making it difficult to rent farm tools or using tricks during the threshing process to recover the rent reduction and even make more profit. Therefore, the first step must be to break this dependent relationship; otherwise, talk of rent reduction was meaningless.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But with that came a problem. To this day, he had never seen a land contract, let alone understood the local tenancy relationships. The tenants outright refused to show their contracts and denied any connection between their uncooperative attitude and the Bek. As for the truth, it was obvious.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Lost in thought, Zhou Youming wandered aimlessly through the village, eventually returning to the workstation, exhausted. Opening the door, he found his comrades similarly gloomy, staring into the fire.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'You look worried...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The people don’t dare to speak out!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Zhou Youming slammed his notebook on the table. He didn’t mean to show his frustration, but he had a fire inside him that needed to come out.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I don’t know what that Bek or Hodja—or whatever the hell they’re called—said to the tenants, but they’re all dead set on not showing the contracts... Without evidence, we can’t just barge in with Mausers and drag the old mule out! At this rate, the people will be too scared of the Bek to talk, too scared of us to act, and our work will be pointless!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu No one responded. Zhou Youming took a deep breath, then sat heavily on a bench. After some thought, he decided to write a letter to report the situation. He tore out the useless notes from his notebook, crumpled them up, and tossed them into the stove before beginning to write."

He and Zhao Feng had been taking turns knocking on the door for half an hour, but the small house remained silent, with no sign that anyone was coming to open the door. Yang Wei knew that the only imam in the village lived here; they had confirmed the address multiple times and knew that this imam hadn’t gone out today, yet here they were, faced with this awkward silence.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu '...That old dog of a Hui.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The same curse slipped out of both their mouths. In truth, they had expected this—while the tenant farmers had kindly pointed the way, they also mentioned, with some concern, that the imam had been inexplicably called away after prayers a few days ago.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I saw a man in a white turban speaking to him from a distance, and since then, he hasn’t seen anyone. I’m afraid he might not open the door for you either.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Recalling this, Yang Wei sighed in frustration.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I thought that after Balati was arrested, our work would go more smoothly...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He had reason to be confident. Shortly after Balati was arrested and interrogated, the Soviet Central Committee labeled him as a bad example of collusion between reactionary landlords and oppressors of the people, broadcasting his misdeeds. A few days later, the traveling courts in Xinjiang began receiving complaints from the people. Although the complainants were still somewhat fearful, it was a significant improvement from the previous state of having no cases to hear. Encouraged by this success, Yang Wei and Zhao Feng came to contact the local imam today, hoping to build on the momentum.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'But this new sect moves faster than we do.' Zhao Feng stubbed out his cigarette in the mud. 'Looks like we’ll have to come back another day. No matter what those old dogs said, we must win the support of the impoverished imams.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Yang Wei pressed his lips together. As an old Red Army soldier, he was a staunch atheist, but that didn’t mean the common people in the base area could quickly change their beliefs—at least not in the short term. For now, their lives still couldn’t do without religion. In this situation, even if they brought down one corrupt imam, another would just be pushed into place, leading to an endless cycle. Therefore, they needed to spread new teachings and eliminate the authority of the new sect from the root.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But who would spread these teachings...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He looked up at the low house."

 COX.47.d:"£gezifu £gezifu A sergeant in his thirties was smoking. Today, his unit had been assigned to maintain order at the land distribution site—even though the Soviets had completed the pacification of Xinjiang, their control over the grassroots level still hadn’t surpassed that of Sheng Shicai’s government. Today, they were here to redistribute the land of the landlords and gentry. Of course, the most notorious of them had already been executed during the liberation of Xinjiang. Now, the mission was to force more landlords to redistribute their land. This process was not smooth, as many landlords were unwilling to give up their 'wealth' passed down through generations and openly resisted the Soviets. Because of this, they had to deploy regular troops to maintain order during the distribution...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Fortunately, this time, the landlords only occasionally cast hostile glances but didn’t resort to violence. The sergeant even took out a cigarette and lit it. Watching the orderly land distribution and the joy on the faces of poor farmers as they received their land, the sergeant took a deep drag.

White bricks, along with snow-like dust, flew in all directions, forming a stark contrast with the dark-skinned workers.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Several devout Islamic believers knelt trembling before the collapsing mosque, murmuring prayers as if pleading with their God. More believers simply stood in the snow-white dust, faces flushed, breathing heavily, their large eyes fixed on the tireless Red Army soldiers.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Good job, Deputy Battalion Commander Wang—I mean, now it’s Battalion Commander Wang.' The young guard Liu Jian cracked a joke.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Thanks to them,' Wang Xing pointed with his notebook at the imams bowing in the distance, 'We’re short on manpower for the movement to nationalize religious sites, so officers below battalion level are all being pulled in.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Before Wang Xing finished speaking, a few young soldiers pushing carts filled with shattered glass shouted for the two to move aside. Liu Jian glanced at the broken glass on the cart. 'Commander Wang, isn’t it strange? These glass pieces glittered like gold when mounted on the roof, but now that they’re shattered and taken down, they’ve lost all their luster.' Saying this, Liu Jian couldn’t help but laugh.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wang Xing, with his inscrutable expression, didn’t answer Liu’s question. His sharp gaze remained fixed on the mosque, now missing its dome. He merely teased, 'You’re getting good at this guard duty, talking all fancy like that.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Seeing that Wang Xing had no interest in continuing the discussion, Liu Jian slipped into the construction site to see if any workers needed help.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The sun soon ended its day’s work. Liu Jian plopped down on a still-warm pile of straw, stretching lazily, his face still full of curiosity. 'Commander Wang, why do you think the people here are so devout in their religion?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wang Xing closed his notebook. 'Because they have no control over their own lives. They can only pray to gods and Buddhas for a full stomach. But many of those in power in the religious institutions have only exacerbated the situation, leaving the people more ignorant and impoverished.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Hmph!

The faint moonlight fell upon a grove of poplar trees, illuminating their straight trunks.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu In the forest, two poplar trees seemed to come alive, slowly moving their shadows northeastward under the moonlight. As the wind eased, it became clear that they were two people, wrapped in blankets, supporting each other as they walked. When the wind died down a bit, it became clear that they were two people wrapped in blankets, supporting each other as they walked. Closer inspection revealed that they were wearing military uniforms, covered in poplar leaves and sand, as if they had just survived a brutal battle. If not for a closer look, they could easily be mistaken for two poplar trees in the dim night. The younger soldier’s arm was bound to his waist with tattered cloth, apparently broken, leaving him to hang a submachine gun around his chest. His cap was nowhere to be seen. He was supporting the older man, who wore glasses, dragged one leg behind him, and was missing his left arm. His face was still embedded with some horrifying shrapnel, and half his body was drenched in blood, making him look like a vengeful ghost from hell.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The two men hobbled forward, braving the north wind.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The surrounding poplar trees stood tall, like sentinels guarding these two men. The poplars bravely faced the fierce north wind, standing unyielding in the sandy soil.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The older man stopped, seemingly unable to continue. He shouted something, but the younger man stubbornly pulled him up onto his back. The older soldier didn’t have the strength to resist; he merely said:\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Go on, go on without me. If you’re slowed down because of me, the comrades who covered our retreat... won’t rest in peace.' This man spoke with a scholarly tone, as if he had once been a teacher.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Old brother, you survived the Long March... don’t...' The young soldier started to say something but trailed off, too exhausted to continue. He just kept trudging forward in silence.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The poplar trees are just an ordinary kind of tree, ubiquitous in China. They are as resilient as Chinese farmers. In the northwest, you can always find a poplar tree standing tall on a barren plain, straight and unwavering, or a row of poplars huddled together, like sentinels, protecting a patch of green grass from the ravages of the wind and sand.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After walking for a while longer, the north wind grew stronger. The young soldier stumbled and fell, and both men collapsed to the ground. After about four or five minutes, the young soldier struggled to his feet, trying to lift the older man back onto his back.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Get up, don’t sleep, old brother.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The old soldier didn’t respond. Instead, he took off the Budyonny cap with the red star embroidered on it, handing it to the young soldier.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu '...Live on, take this hat. Inside, there’s my allowance and a letter for my wife.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The old soldier watched the young soldier walk away into the wind. He felt his body grow colder, so he painstakingly fished out half a cigarette from his pocket and held it in his mouth, hoping the smoke would warm him up, but he couldn’t find any matches. He knew he was probably going to die, but he was surprisingly calm about it—perhaps he had seen death too many times.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He spat out the cigarette, propping himself up with one hand, and looked around at the poplar trees standing tall in the howling wind.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Heh, these poplar trees are a lot like us.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The poplar trees are an unremarkable, yet resilient species, never bowing to the raging wind. They may not be grand, but they are steadfast and upright. They have an incredible will to live, much like the most humble people of this land, who withstand the fierce winds of darkness.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The young soldier had walked further away, while the old soldier lay still on the ground. The north wind howled even louder, dimming the moonlight once more. But in the pitch-black night, against the biting wind, there was the faint, raspy sound of singing.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The hateful wind roars above our heads... the forces of darkness strike us with deadly blows...'"

Perhaps this was why Chairman Mao Anying chose her to be the newly appointed secretary of the Religious Affairs Bureau. Her appearance reflected her character—she had long chestnut hair, and years of battle had given her a full, tall figure. Her legs were as long and straight as a compass, and she wore stiff-soled riding boots, clacking confidently as she walked through the room, conversing with people, beautiful yet haughty.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The office building of the Religious Affairs Bureau was right next to the Soviet building. Now, the room was filled with prominent religious figures, and with a wave of her hand, Ulyanova had a few burly soldiers 'politely' escort two prominent Lamas and two old Imams into a small room.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The Chairman intends to manage religion well through the supervision of the local Soviets... We hope for your full cooperation.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Ulyanova’s Chinese wasn’t perfect, but it was clear enough. The conversation went on, and the old Imams were cooperative—having witnessed the Soviet’s iron fist crush the resistance of the new sects, they were more than willing to comply. The two prominent Lamas, however, were more slippery, responding to Ulyanova’s persistent questions with nothing but vague statements and repeated 'Amitabha,' leaving the meaning unclear.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The two Lamas quietly sipped their tea, presenting themselves as hardened veterans, while the younger Lama’s eyes roved over Ulyanova.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Does this bald donkey think I’m one of his followers’ wives... staring at me like that.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Ulyanova waved for the two Imams to leave and have some tea, then, suppressing her anger, she patiently asked, 'Would the Lamas be willing to hand over the old reincarnation seals for the Soviet government to manage the subsequent matters...?' She forced a seductive smile, despite the wrinkles, as she spoke.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I’m terribly sorry, but our temple...’ The younger Lama, about fifty years old, glanced at the older Lama before continuing, 'Our temple’s reincarnation seals have been lost.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Ulyanova noticed their little exchange, but she kept smiling, stood up, sipped her tea from a lidded bowl, and asked gently, 'When you say lost, do you mean you can’t find them?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, yes, with old age comes forgetfulness, you know, and we just can’t find them.' The two Lamas smiled, feeling smug, thinking they had met an easy woman.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As the younger Lama was savoring his tea leaves, Ulyanova suddenly kicked him in the face with her hard-soled boots, smashing the lidded bowl, and sending white porcelain shards deep into his face. He felt himself being roughly lifted by the collar, and then a rain of punches hit his stomach, leaving him in excruciating pain.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The hand let go, and the younger Lama fell to the ground, spitting out a few teeth and a mouthful of blood, staring at Ulyanova, clutching his stomach, unable to speak. The rest was simple; Ulyanova’s excellent surgical skills successfully cured the two old Lamas of their amnesia. The soldiers present witnessed this medical miracle, and after spilling the beans, the two old Lamas were sent to the labor camp.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A secretary recorded the event to be submitted to the Soviet Presidium: The religious figures all expressed their agreement with the Soviet’s centralized management of religious affairs.

I told you long ago to move out quickly!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “He won't listen to reason, fine! Auntie, he insists on the rent reduction, and I only have one life!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou cursed angrily. He had thought of escaping, but with his old mother, wife, and three children, it wouldn't be easy. Earlier, one tenant household had escaped, and Master Burka came to warn them that if it happened again, they would all have to repay the runaway's arrears from previous years. This made him even more hesitant, fearing to implicate others, yet also afraid that others would leak the news.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Your family is bigger than ours. We’re just two old folks, it doesn't matter if we stay and work like oxen, it's up to you.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Auntie sighed and walked away.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou spat out two words, “I won’t!” and then walked home.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His home consisted of three thatched huts, with the roof of the leftmost hut about to collapse. There was a small drying yard in front of the door, and at the end of the yard was flat farmland. His mother was pulling beans with the oldest grandchild. Seeing her son approaching, she straightened up and stood still.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Although his mother was tall, she was now just skin and bones. She stared blankly as her son approached.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou shouted: “Auntie makes it sound easy, as if we could just leave with a stomp of a straw sandal.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The bean stalk suddenly slipped from his mother’s hand, and she bitterly said: “If you can escape, then escape! Don’t worry about me!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou was silent for a moment, then shouted: “Let him cook us all in one pot!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou’s wife, a woman with drooping mouth corners and a sallow face, rushed out of the house, nervously asking: “He still won’t agree?!” Li Dayou cursed: “That damned old Burka is utterly vile! He keeps repeating the same thing, you could offer him a chicken leg, and he still wouldn’t budge!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu She sighed deeply and sat down on a piece of wood by the door.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A two-year-old daughter, dressed in rags and with a bloodless face, was crawling in the dirt at one end of the wood. She was playing intently with the gray dirt but now walked toward her mother. The mother slapped her across the face, then both mother and child began to cry together.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu While crying, his wife said: “Even if we sell the bean stalks, it still won't be enough for her!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His mother trembled as she spoke: “I won’t burden you, quickly find a way to escape!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou shouted in frustration: “Escape?! If we run, he’ll cause trouble for others! You heard it the other day…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His wife grabbed him and said: “If you had listened to me earlier, this wouldn’t have happened! We should have moved long ago!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Move where?”"

COX.54.d:"£gezifu £gezifu After the first failed attempt, she had suggested to her husband that they go to her brother to rent some land and quietly move away. But Dayou had too many concerns and still held illusions about Master Burka. Now, he regretted it.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Dayou weakly defended himself: “If I had known that another tenant would leave first…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His wife also became impatient and sat down on the ground, almost like throwing a tantrum, saying: “We might as well just die here, if the beans aren't enough, we'll sell the kids, sell me too!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou didn’t know what to say, he just stomped his feet and cursed: “Damn it…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He also started to resent that unseen Mr. Mao because if it weren’t for the rent reduction, none of these troubles would have arisen. When the rent reduction order was first announced, like the other tenants, he had been genuinely happy. He thought that since the rent was heavy and this year’s harvest was poor, he could reduce his debt. But who knew that Master Burka would use the rent reduction to deceive!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His wife and mother had nowhere to vent their anger, so they joined in cursing. After venting their frustration, the old question forced them to find an answer: stay or run?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou went to his wife's elder brother that night, to a very remote mountain valley.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His brother-in-law didn’t know what to say. He had lived there for three generations and knew the reality of the place well. He dreamed of moving out. Even if he couldn’t rent farmland in the plains, even mountain land would be better. Because this place was too desolate, even the mountains and forests were unfriendly. And the tenancy conditions were unfavorable, making it impossible to improve their situation!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “What’s the point of moving here?” his brother-in-law asked.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Dayou replied desperately: “There’s nowhere else to go! We have no food.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His brother-in-law said: “Then you’ll have to come and scrape by! Scrape by for a lifetime, just like me!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Dayou took a deep breath and hung his head; then he suddenly lifted his face and wailed: “I just want to survive right now!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The decision was quickly made, with his brother-in-law acting as a guarantor to help Dayou rent land from the Burka here.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The Burka here warned: “There’s no rent reduction here.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Dayou hastily replied: “No!… No!… No rent reduction!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Right, and what’s a little debt? Don’t take it too seriously. Ask your brother-in-law, he still owes quite a bit.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His brother-in-law smiled awkwardly, then sighed, saying:\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “That’s why I’ll always be an ox for him!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu However, Dayou couldn’t worry about that now; as long as he wasn’t driven to hang himself, he was lucky.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou walked home, constantly thinking about what he should do. But he finally figured it out. He would pretend to visit relatives, first letting his mother take the eldest child and go, then his wife would take the two younger ones. He would stay behind to move the furniture. That way, even taking small paths would be easier. Because he didn’t have much furniture, all the junk could barely fill a single basket. By the time he reached the village entrance, it was already mid-afternoon. On the way, he met his auntie resting by the roadside, with a basket standing behind her.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Auntie had just finished milling and was on her way back. She greeted him with a tone of mild reproach: “I’ve tried to persuade you time and again, but you wouldn’t listen!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “That damned old Burka…!” Hearing her words, he hurried home, hanging his head in dejection.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His wife was breastfeeding their child on the steps. Seeing his sullen face, she asked with some concern:\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Didn’t you manage to rent the land?”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou didn’t answer, so his wife’s suspicion deepened.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His wife immediately complained, saying: “I guessed it! There’s barren land everywhere…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou suddenly jumped up, crying out in a tearful voice: “You just knew I couldn’t rent the land?!…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His wife laughed shyly and sighed: “Look at that horse face of yours…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou interrupted her, saying: “You’re the only one happy, wanting to leave whenever you feel like it!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His mother came out of the house, saying: “Don’t worry about me, — if the land is rented, just go quickly!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Dayou stomped his foot and angrily shouted:"

COX.55.t:"A New Day at the Wonton Stall"
COX.55.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Today is a joyful day, and the entire city of Turpan is immersed in a festive atmosphere. Whether it’s the pedestrians on the street or the vendors selling wontons by the roadside, everyone has smiles on their faces, and some even dance in the streets with joy.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The wonton stall owner, Muhammad Wubuli, was concentrating on kneading the dough in his hands. He was very diligent; he could make everything from naan to wontons to noodles, but even so, he couldn’t save much money each year. The Akhund who used to come to eat never paid, and every month there were oil money, prayer money, and a tithe, which in reality was more like one-fifth. Every time the Akhund recited, "May Allah be with you," and came with a group of henchmen to collect taxes, Wubuli could only mutter under his breath, "Damn Muhammad, bringing out this bunch of lackeys." Then he would obediently pay the taxes.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He had been paying these taxes for many years, and each year they precisely took away his meager savings. Gradually, he felt that hard work wasn’t getting him anywhere, and he became more and more dispirited.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But today was different. It was already time to collect taxes, yet the Akhund, wrapped in a turban, had not arrived, which made Wubuli very curious. Then a few old customers, Brother Li and Little Ali, who were porters at a nearby warehouse, came by. Usually, after a day’s work and paying taxes, they only had enough money left for a few bowls of noodles, but today was different. They eagerly ordered several large bowls of meat-filled wontons and even a few bowls of liquor. Wubuli found this very strange and, after inquiring, learned that a new regulation had come from Dihua: starting today, all incense taxes except for the zakat could be waived.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As Brother Li spoke, he carefully took out a copy of the "Sparks Newspaper" from the sweat-soaked pocket of his vest and began reading in a stammering manner.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “It is decreed that all new Akhunds and associated mosques shall no longer collect any taxes outside of zakat starting today…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Brother Li, what is this new Akhund?” Little Ali interjected.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “I don’t know either…” Brother Li wiped his sweat, put down the newspaper, and picked up his bowl of liquor. “Whoever doesn’t collect taxes, I’ll support them.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After finishing their meal and drink, Little Ali and Brother Li waved goodbye to Wubuli. The wonton stall owner cleaned up the dishes while silently pondering. He wasn’t sure if the new policy was right, but he secretly felt a sense of joy."

COX.56.d:"£gezifu £gezifu The morning comes early in Xinjiang. The faint moon still hangs in the distant sky, and the air is still a bit cold, but Abdul was already up early to tend to the farm. Abdul exhaled a cloud of white breath and took his hands out of his pockets to rub them together vigorously.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As he opened the door to the cattle pen, a pungent smell hit him, and he instinctively covered his mouth and coughed lightly. Then, he pressed his left hand against the joint of his right arm and pulled it upwards with force. "This body is getting worse every day…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Grandpa, Grandpa, are you going out to work so early again? Let me do it, you’re not getting any younger!” Niyati ran out from inside and grabbed his hand.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “No!” He slapped his granddaughter’s hand away. “You silly girl, go back and smear some mud on your face! Be careful, or you’ll be seen again!” Niyati’s face darkened, and she immediately lowered her head and ran back into the house. Watching his granddaughter’s retreating figure, his eyes welled up, but he held back his tears. How are they going to get through this? Tomorrow, the landlord will come to collect the rent, and the day after tomorrow, those Akhunds will come for the Eid donation. If it were just about money, it would be fine, but that damn Balati has also taken a liking to his granddaughter. Damn it, if that wretched dog dares to lay a finger on her, Abdul swore he would fight him to the death.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Niyati returned to her room and carefully pulled out a flyer from under her pillow. She had sneaked out several times to listen outside the window of the literacy class run by the Chinese Brigade, so she recognized a few big characters, but the most striking was still that red star. “Chi…Chiwei…Guard…Unity, Unity…Reform…Reform the new religion…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu She had made up her mind. The moment Balati’s gaze fell on her, she knew this couldn’t end peacefully. She had always been timid, but when she thought of the upright Chinese Brigade, of those spirited soldiers in the literacy class, and how they smiled and said to her after class, "Come to us if you have any difficulties," she gained a bit more courage. She took the flyer and ran out the door…\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Yang Wei was pacing back and forth in the room. The room was filled with newly recruited Red Guards. Ever since the Chinese Brigade soldiers dispersed to the countryside, the armed forces had also scattered. His team consisted of either poor farmers or old Akhunds united by the central government, and their weapons were mostly shotguns and homemade cannons. They would surely lose in a direct confrontation with the warlords. But if they could catch evidence of collusion between the new Akhunds and the landlords…\n\n£gezifu £gezifu In recent investigations, he had come to understand that the grassroots people were on the verge of an uprising. Just a spark could set the grasslands ablaze.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The door was knocked on. Yang Wei instinctively grabbed the Mosin-Nagant rifle at his side and cocked it, but Old Zhao stopped him.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Listen to that voice!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Isn’t it the day for our contact?”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Strange, let’s see who it is first.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Zhao Feng took the Mauser pistol in his hand and quietly approached the door. He looked out through the peephole—a little girl stood anxiously at the door—he recognized her, a student from the literacy class.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He opened the door and let her in, glancing outside to see if anyone was there, then quickly closed the door.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Please, help my grandfather! The landlord will come to collect the rent tomorrow, and the day after that, Balati will…will…”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Miss, slow down, who is Balati, and what’s going on?”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “The landlord told Balati, that Akhund, that I’m quite pretty, and now Balati wants to forcefully marry me!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Yang Wei picked up a thick booklet and flipped through it.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Old Zhao, Balati isn’t on the list, he must be one of the new Akhunds.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After thinking for a moment, Yang Wei showed a sly smile:"

I’m telling you, those fools don’t understand, just add another donation or something, tell them it will bring Allah’s blessing sooner, and it’s done…hehehe!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Muhammad, how did your dumb brain suddenly get so clever!

He loaded his gun with a knowing expression and called out to his comrades to get in the truck and head to Dihua People’s Court.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Since it’s an order from that leader… it probably means a heavy-handed approach.” He understood it this way because that leader was ruthless when it came to killing reactionaries.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Dihua People’s Court was particularly lively today, not because of the usual crowd coming to settle disputes, but because various “enforcement teams” from religious courts had surrounded the place.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Earlier that morning, a young couple was sentenced to whipping by a small religious court for some trivial matter. Unwilling to accept it, they came to the People’s Court seeking the protection of the “Red Army of Allah,” but they were followed by an “enforcement team” of religious courts armed with long knives and guns. They had long been dissatisfied with the People’s Court’s “monopoly on justice.”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The soldiers at the gate were trying to stop them from entering, and a few minority cadres were also trying to persuade them in their dialect.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “This is the People’s Court… you can’t take anyone away!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “People’s Court? Only Allah and the Akhund have the right to judge the wicked!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Back off now, or I’ll have to use force!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But this group of nearly a hundred people didn’t care about reason. A bearded man waved his hand, seemingly signaling an attack on the People’s Court. The two soldiers at the gate looked like tiny sesame seeds, about to be overwhelmed by the “enforcement team.” The ones at the front had already started grabbing the soldiers’ guns.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Screech—screech—” With the ear-piercing sound of brakes, heavily armed soldiers jumped out of two trucks, led by the Political Security Bureau’s Direct Battalion Captain, Li Guofu.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Damn it, your Red Army grandpa is here!” a tall soldier shouted angrily upon seeing the situation.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The soldiers charged into the crowd, and a few clueless “enforcement team” members fired shots in protest, trying to seize the soldiers’ guns. Some even boldly pointed their guns at the soldiers. Suddenly, a man with a headscarf accidentally fired his gun, hitting the ground near a soldier’s foot.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The air went silent for a moment; that gunshot successfully ignited the powder keg. The soldiers roared and charged forward, meeting the rebels with rifle butts and bullets. After knocking down dozens of rebels and executing a few stubborn ones, Li Guofu was shot in the chest by an iron-sand gun, but luckily the charge was light, so he wasn’t seriously injured. Covered in blood, looking terrifying, he led the soldiers to capture the bearded man who was trying to escape. They then disarmed the “enforcement team,” tied them up in a line, and, to the cheers of the crowd, marched them into Dihua People’s Court at gunpoint.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The first trial at Dihua People’s Court began.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu From now on, the reactionaries in southern Xinjiang would think twice before resisting Soviet government decrees.

A large red disk hung on the horizon, and it could even be looked at directly, but unlike usual times, Haz's shadow was not stretching out long behind him but was instead gathered at his feet. This was because the torch in his hand was emitting a brilliant light, forcing the shadow down to his feet.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Is this all of it?” Two men carried another large box, filled with the same worthless scraps of paper. Haz waved at them, signaling, “Yes, this is all of it!” The two men dropped the box on the ground and said, “We turned the house of the Eight Master inside out, and we even searched through the wool piles three times. It’s impossible to hide a single IOU!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Good job, well done!” Haz smiled, bringing the torch closer to the pile of paper, the firelight illuminating the words on the paper: “Hellegu Township, Ali Pu, borrowed ten jin of grain today, with an interest of two cents…” The IOU was not long, but it was followed by five or six correction marks, indicating that Ali Pu had not repaid the grain on time… Haz smiled slightly; the reason Ali Pu jumped into the river three years ago might have been found.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu However, none of that mattered now.

Marriage, slaughtering, circumcision, naming—all major affairs in the village required his involvement. Sometimes he also had to preach and handle neighborhood disputes. However, his status could not change his fate—his savings had long been drained by the headman’s exploitation. In this village, eight out of ten households used the headman’s land, and the remaining two households still paid for the headman’s well. But all the villagers owed money to the headman to some extent. The last time Ahmed’s son fell seriously ill and borrowed the headman’s cart, the headman was not satisfied with the repayment of ten times the cart’s worth. What Mukhtar Mukhlati didn’t understand was why the headman was so ruthless. The headman’s house had a small pond and an orchard. He had a luxurious life, and everything seemed to be going well.

He looked out of the window and saw the first sunlight breaking through the gaps in the door. The sky gradually brightened, and he got up to pray. The peacefulness of the early morning was not enough to erase his unease. Although he did not know where the headman had obtained the land deed he had forced Mukhtar to sign, he knew that the headman’s greed and cruelty could not be satisfied by mere land deeds. He worried that his own life and that of his children would be sacrificed to satisfy the headman’s demands.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Today was not an ordinary day for Mukhtar Mukhlati; it was the first day of Ramadan. After a long night of fasting, he had already prayed, eaten the meal before dawn, and was ready to enter the fast. He tried to forget the annoying worries and focused his thoughts on his prayers. However, the peace of the morning was not enough to dispel his anxiety. He worried about the future and the burden of his debts, which was as heavy as a mountain. As the imam, he had to set an example for the villagers. In front of others, he had to show a strong faith and unshakeable confidence, but behind closed doors, he was filled with dread and concern. This was a reality that only Mukhtar Mukhlati himself could bear. No one else knew his true worries and fears. As he performed the prayer rituals, the cries for help and the tortured faces of the villagers flashed through his mind. He would silently pray for them, hoping that the dawn of this first day of Ramadan would bring a new beginning for everyone."

In a few minutes, he would be on stage to summarize the month's work. This was his first time speaking in front of so many people, and just six months ago, he was an unnamed laborer under the landlord. He couldn't forget the afternoon he saw the Red Army execute the landlord in the square. From that moment, he became a real person.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “Next, Comrade Hadik will give the work summary report for this month!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu This sentence brought Hadik back from his memories. He unfolded his speech, which was already damp with sweat, and walked nervously onto the makeshift stage.

Thanks to the selfless work of our former association leader, Comrade Tan Jiali!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Tan Jiali sat in the fifth row, smiling and applauding the praise Hadik was giving him. He thought to himself that Hadik was flattering him, and he would need to criticize him after the meeting.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “This month, our association carried out a campaign to eradicate bad customs. Until yesterday, we successfully mobilized women to work in the fields, allowing them to no longer be confined to their homes. We also converted the village mosque into a Red Army primary school, giving boys and girls in the village equal educational rights. This is very valuable, and we should strive to minimize the continued influence of religion on our next generation!”\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Another round of enthusiastic applause followed. Hadik seemed to be fully ignited by the comrades' passion, and his Mandarin became more fluent.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu “In the coming month, our association will cooperate with surrounding villages to establish a farmers' militia with the aim of protecting the current reform achievements and eliminating bandits around several villages. This work has already begun. Additionally, the association will actively expand its membership.

In addition to conducting a preliminary investigation of local agricultural production conditions and production relations, we also focused on studying the class consciousness of the serf class in accordance with central directives, which is the main content of this report.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Due to time constraints and the local population's unfamiliarity with our party, although our action cadres no longer have to constantly worry about their safety as they did at the beginning, for safety reasons, our team adopted a low-profile and cautious investigation method to avoid arousing the vigilance of reactionaries and causing unnecessary risks to comrades. Although the information obtained this way has limited breadth and depth, it still accurately reflects the real conditions of the feudal rural areas in Aksu and provides a reference for advancing land reform.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu In our investigation, we found that, at least in Aksu, the oppressed class represented by the serfs is not as enthusiastic about the revolution as we had previously imagined, and their level of class consciousness is even more shocking. Among the more than thirty serfs we surveyed randomly, two-thirds believed that it was the "generous benevolence" of the landlords that provided them with food, and some serfs even begged the Soviet not to overthrow the landlords and seize the land, otherwise, they would starve to death without land to farm.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Perhaps our team’s survey conclusions are not universal across the entire region, but it is clear that the lack of class consciousness and the deficiency in the laborers’ awareness of their own power will severely affect the masses' correct understanding of the revolution and their enthusiasm for participating in it.

For instance, the Khotan Mosque has occupied more than 6,000 acres of land near the mosque.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu According to the field investigation, local grassroots imams and the masses have complaints about religious leaders, but due to weak class consciousness and the ruling class’s use of religious reasons to obscure their exploitation motives, the local people lack fighting spirit and hold fatalistic views, believing that exploitation is “the will of Allah.” This makes it difficult to provoke large-scale resistance.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu In the feudal era, clergy were the educated group. Therefore, clergy could easily deceive farmers and also easily turn farmers against landlords. Historically, there have often been instances of clergy joining the ruling class or being part of the ruling class exploiting farmers. However, some conscientious clergy have helped farmers resist the brutal rule of the feudal ruling class. These clergy have low status within the religion, and some imams are impoverished. Consideration could be given to attracting poor imams and competing with high-ranking imams for religious interpretive rights.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Our team believes that this report accurately reflects the situation in the Khotan area, which may differ from other regions in Xinjiang but can still be used as a reference.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu \n\n£gezifu £gezifu                            Communist Party of China Khotan Branch Land Reform Investigation Team 3"

The Communist Party will not lead the New Alliance.

As a result, the water conservancy system had become chaotic, and it was difficult to coordinate and plan. The district leaders became increasingly anxious about this situation and realized that this situation could not be allowed to continue.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The establishment of the Water Conservancy Bureau was precisely a solution to this problem.

Countless grassroots Red Army soldiers had visited villages large and small in the shortest possible time, actively engaging with the masses of peasants and initiating the reform of the Farmers’ Associations.

The work in the fields became sporadic, and she was the only one left to manage. When the war broke out, her husband was naturally conscripted into the army. Now, besides children, there were no men left in the village. Originally, she could still manage to farm on her own, but this cursed unnamed village, located near the front lines, was bombed every few days. Although Xiuying’s family was still alive, the land was completely ruined.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A few days ago, her mother suddenly fell seriously ill, but no one could see her—the village’s herbal doctor had already gone to the army, and her mother cried out and suffered as she passed away. Yesterday, her husband’s body was also returned.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Xiuying, your husband is one of the lucky ones, at least he’s intact. I heard some kids were hit so badly, there wasn’t a single piece of good flesh left...' The neighbor aunt sighed as she looked at her husband’s body.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Xiuying didn’t listen to the old woman’s chatter. She just stared blankly at her husband’s body one moment, then at her three children, none older than ten. 'Old Gui (husband), you’re gone, how are we supposed to live...' The words slipped out of her mouth. She fell into a daze again—no land, no livelihood; her mother was gone, her husband was gone. There was nothing left for her in this place; she might as well run. But where?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Why is there so much chaos here... I heard Xinjiang has changed, a group of some Red Army has arrived... I heard a lot of people are heading that way...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu This time, Xiuying paid attention to the old woman’s chatter. Xinjiang? Xinjiang! They’re not fighting over there, are they? Fine, we’ll go there!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Early the next morning, Xiuying quietly closed the door, carrying her three-year-old daughter and a few belongings.

Some even began to weep. Xiuying also lowered her head, but she didn’t cry. She thought about her life back in Qinghai; it was truly hopeless. Every day she woke up thinking about how to feed her family, then went to bed hungry, day after day, with no end in sight...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After a long journey, she finally brought her three children to Xinjiang, but her belongings had been confiscated by the Ma Family Army in Qinghai. Now, besides her three children, she had nothing. She was completely destitute.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The old farmer stepped down, and a well-dressed official took the stage. He must be one of the local officials in Xinjiang, gathering them here for some sort of 'complaint meeting.' Xiuying didn’t want to come, but when she crossed the border, she was caught by the soldiers here. She heard that after this meeting, there would be a meal—how long had it been since they had a full meal? Whatever, she thought, let’s just get a meal first, then we’ll have the strength to go into the city and look for work... She figured these officials were just holding the meeting to save face and would kick them out afterward. Xiuying thought this sarcastically as she looked at the refugees around her, crying. 'Cry all you want, once you’re out of strength and they kick you out, let’s see how you’ll keep crying! All the officials are the same everywhere!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu On stage, Captain Tang wiped his tears, 'Fellow villagers, we are deeply sorry for what you have endured, but I assure you that in Xinjiang, you will embrace a brand-new life! The days of suffering are over!' Xiuying let out another sarcastic snort from below the stage.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Then it was mealtime—meat, of all things! Fragrant lamb soup, freshly baked naan, and greasy roasted lamb! My goodness, these officials really went all out! Even during festivals in Qinghai, they didn’t serve meat... Her three children were laughing and grabbing at the meat, and Xiuying smiled. It had been so long since she’d seen her children this happy, so long since she’d smiled, so long...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After the meal, Xiuying thought it was over and prepared to take her children to the city. But instead, she was taken to a large courtyard—so big! A Red Army soldier led her family into one of the rooms in the courtyard, smiling as he said, 'You can stay here.' She had planned to run, but the two young soldiers with guns at the door made her too scared, and she spent the night anxiously. The next day, more officials came, asking her questions—what was her name, how many people were in her family, what could she do? She answered them all, and surprisingly, these officials didn’t put on any airs and even chatted with her! On the third day, she was taken to a field, and the leader told her, 'This field is yours to farm. Just deliver the required amount of grain—it’s really not much! I could meet the quota in a day!—and the rest is yours.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'What?!' Xiuying was shocked, 'You’re giving me this land to farm for free?' Even though she had heard that people here were given land, it was still hard to believe when she heard it herself.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, sister, and we’ll buy your grain later at a fair price!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Xiuying returned to her residence, her mind blank. The children were playing in the courtyard with kids their age, and as she listened to their laughter, she cried."

The neighbors to the south were restless, with bandits frequently causing trouble, and sometimes even Ma’s regular army would come to 'requisition' supplies. Border duty had naturally become the most demanding task, which annoyed Li Er, who had long mastered the 'philosophy of survival.' But what could he do? A soldier’s job was to follow orders, and he understood this well.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He reached out to adjust the wick of the kerosene lamp, resting his head in his hands, intending to take a nap (disciplinary action be damned, who cares? The captain wouldn’t see it anyway). But suddenly, the door burst open with a bang, and a new recruit rushed in, looking panicked. Li Er instantly became alert, his drowsiness vanished. 'You look like someone just died at home!' Li Er cursed angrily, but the new recruit, gasping for breath, said, 'Uncle Li... the bandits on the other side... they’re attacking, our guys are barely holding on, you’re a good shot... come and help us!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'What?' Li Er was momentarily stunned. This bunch of rascals—usually just making a fuss was enough, but this time they’re serious? Without thinking, he grabbed his gun, mounted a horse, and followed the recruit to the scene.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After riding for only a few minutes, Li Er heard gunfire. From a distance, he could see that his new recruit squad was engaged in a firefight with a group of bandits, but both sides were so poor at shooting that after a long exchange of fire, neither side had suffered any casualties. However, the bandits seemed to have realized they were dealing with new recruits and were slowly advancing.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu '...These rookies...' Li Er sighed in exasperation, but he couldn’t blame them; they had only been in the army for a few months, and they could barely hold their rifles!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Er took out his semi-automatic rifle, aimed at a bandit’s leg, and fired. The bandit fell to the ground with a cry (after all, he had been a soldier for twenty years), and he quickly shot another one. After taking down three bandits, the rest, realizing they were up against a tough opponent, hurriedly retreated, while Li Er managed to shoot one more in the head.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The soldiers peeked out from their cover, 'What are you standing there for? Capture them alive!' Li Er shouted, quickly tying up one of the bandits. 'Hehe, I’ve earned a merit,' he thought.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu By the time they handed over the three captured bandits, it was already two hours later. Li Er led his squad back to the camp, exhausted. One of the recruits couldn’t help but complain, 'Uncle Li, why is border duty so tough and exhausting? We have to face these bandits every day.' Li Er glanced at him, 'It’s only been a few days? The hard times are still ahead!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu That night, Li Er lay down on his bunk and quickly fell asleep.

When Li Er officially appeared before the refugees, he looked quite different from before. His demeanor had also changed, giving him a completely new image.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu "Ah, you are?" The leader, an elderly man of about fifty or sixty, looked around. Most of the group were old people and children; there were hardly any young men in their twenties or thirties.

Ever since the Ma family suffered a defeat in Ningxia, their government's credibility has greatly diminished.

Somehow, a rumor spread that the banks had no money and the government was going to print more, devaluing the currency into worthless paper! Not long after, a large-scale run on the banks broke out in Xining. The banks, of course, couldn't produce the money because all of it had gone into the Ma family's pockets. So, crowds of people demanding their money gathered in front of the banks, causing quite a scene. The people of Xining were all watching. It's said that later, Ma's private soldiers, dressed in white, charged into the crowd demanding money, forming a long snake formation, and beat people mercilessly, not even sparing the disabled, some of whom were beaten to death.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Chen Geng coughed and continued, 'Another point is that many of those who deposited money were refugees from the interior, who had earned that money by working in unsafe conditions for the Ma family. Now that their life savings have vanished overnight, it's said that riots have already started. The unrest is significant, with riots breaking out not only in Xining but also in other places. This has further exacerbated the conflict between locals and outsiders. Sadly, the local ethnic groups themselves are not in conflict; whether Han, Hui, or Uyghur, past tensions have not been severe, and they have a strong aversion to the Han people from the interior.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Chen Geng paused before continuing, 'It's said that there are people within the Ma family who are dissatisfied with Ma Jiyuan's actions, but this information may not be entirely accurate, so it should be taken with caution.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Mao Anying thought for a moment before concluding, 'We need to start preparing quickly; the turmoil in Qinghai could easily involve us.'"

Where is he now?' The Imam stepped down from the platform, standing beside the prostrated believer, and asked.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Before anyone could answer, they heard the sound of a large crowd gathering outside the mosque.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The Prophet often visited the gardens of the disciples; he did not despise the poor for their poverty, nor did he fear the power of kings; he treated everyone equally and called them all to the path of Allah. The Prophet was the least likely to get angry, the most inclined to joy, the most considerate of others, and the kindest to all, always seeking the benefit of the people.'

The Prophet once said, 'Among my people, the poor will enter paradise five hundred years before the wealthy.' He dined with the poor and ate with the impoverished, but here, the leaders are engaged in selfish acts of greed, they are hypocrites.

COX.116.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Early this morning, the soldiers stationed in the village—no, not soldiers, they should be called warriors. The warriors with stars on their hats were busy hammering something.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu This caught the attention of some children. After waking up, they loved to gather around the warriors to listen to their stories.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Warriors, what are you doing this time?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu An old man, leaning on his cane, tremblingly walked over. The warriors and the land reform cadres had been here for a few months now. Just a few days ago, the landlord had been dragged out for trial and sentenced to ten years of labor reform.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Although the warriors were different from the soldiers of the past—they didn’t burn, kill, loot, or forcibly take women—the deep-seated fear of soldiers still made them very afraid.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'This?' The Red Army soldier pointed to the land distribution ruler they were setting up. He said, 'We're building the land distribution ruler. Once we’re done, we can give the land to the villagers.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Give it to us!?' Even though these warriors were disciplined, this decision still greatly shocked the seventy-something-year-old man.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu It seemed that since the day he was born, such a thing had never happened. When had any official ever left food for the peasants? Could it be some kind of trick?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Old man, don’t be frightened. We are the Red Army, and we’re not the same as the Ma family's bandits or the Japanese bandits. We’ve already reformed in Xinjiang, so this isn’t some trick to deceive you.' Seeing the old man’s shocked expression, the Red Army soldier was startled and quickly supported the old man, afraid that he might have an accident.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Red Army, Red Army.' The old man chewed on the words. Reformed in Xinjiang? The old man vaguely remembered hearing rumors about this, but he hadn’t expected them to be true.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, the Red Army. We are the people's army, specifically here to fight landlords and capitalists.' The Red Army soldier spoke as if reciting a lesson.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I understand landlords, but what are capitalists?' The old man was curious.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Well... the rich folks in the village who exploit the peasants are called landlords. Capitalists are the rich folks in the city who exploit workers. Workers and peasants are both oppressed, and we are good partners who specifically fight the oppressors.' The Red Army soldier continued his recitation.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu To be honest, the old man still didn’t fully understand, but he grasped the simple idea that the Red Army was here to help them.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A few children ran past the old man, each holding a small wooden board in their arms.

That so-called Huangzhong Industrial Co., Ltd. is clearly a puppet of the Ma family, tricking us inland folks into investing so they can rake in money.

But then he remembered that his chamber of commerce had already gone bankrupt, and the Ma family had already fallen, so he breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Are you Li Jing, the former president of the Siyang Chamber of Commerce?' one of the leading Red Army soldiers asked.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu At that moment, Li Jing suddenly remembered that these soldiers should be the Communist Party’s soldiers, and the Communists were all about killing the rich to help the poor. Now he was doomed. He quickly bent down and said, 'Soldier, you must have the wrong person. I’m already bankrupt!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Before he could finish, he heard the Red Army soldiers burst into laughter. The leading soldier laughed and slowly said, 'We’re looking for the bankrupt.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Hearing this, Li Jing felt like his soul had left his body, and he nearly collapsed. It seemed he had just escaped the wolf’s den only to fall into the tiger’s lair.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Seeing Li Jing’s distress, one of the Red Army soldiers took out a bag of silver dollars and said, 'We’re just here to purchase your bankrupt chamber of commerce, nothing more.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Realizing it was just a misunderstanding, Li Jing was overjoyed and quickly took the money, saying, 'Soldier, please come inside.

According to the instructions of the Yushu Soviet Congress, we need to search your monastery.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The serfs surrounding the red flag began shouting, crying out things like 'My child was taken by the monastery' and 'My husband...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu These were the serfs that the Red Army work group had painstakingly mobilized over the past month.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The abbot here is a good person.' Fang Hao, a pilgrim standing at the gate, said loudly, though his heart was racing with anxiety.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Fang Hao didn’t believe these rumors. He was a devout Buddhist, and when he was fleeing famine years ago, an old monk had saved his life. How could the monastery be a place of filth and corruption?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The old abbot came out, playing the 'good cop': 'Young benefactor, after all, the monastery is a place of Buddhist practice. Could you please make an exception?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Even the good-natured Red Army squad leader, Zhou Zeming, couldn’t help but darken his face at this moment. 'Abbot, the Red Army has already requested to inspect three times. We must follow procedure. If we make an exception for you, how will other monasteries see us? Our work would become difficult.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The negotiations went nowhere, and the crowd began to grow restless, pushing against the line of monks.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The monks ultimately couldn’t resist the crowd’s shoving. The crowd broke through a gap and then poured in.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Oh my God.'

Their bodies bore countless scars, some of which had scabbed over, while others were still festering.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Oh my God, what is this?' A voice beside him brought him back to his senses, but what had he seen?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A rather crude but clearly carefully polished ritual instrument came into view.

As a poem says, 'The vast desert stretches endlessly, where can one find a home in this boundless expanse?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Apart from a few nomads, few outsiders dare to venture into this harsh land. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Yet, in this dangerous place, a few Red Army soldiers are traveling by horseback and cart. They have already traveled a long way, and a long road still lies ahead. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu As the journey drags on, the soldiers begin to chat. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Squad Leader, I really don't believe those inland warlords can find their way here.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Exactly, I bet they don't even know how to hold a gun.' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Stop the chatter,' Squad Leader Liu cut off their conversation while opening a map. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Thanks to the harsh environment, the population in southern Mengjiang is sparse, and the war between the People's Revolutionary Committee and Japan has driven away the few who were left. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu That's why the Soviet area planned to trade arms with the Jin faction troops here. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Squad Leader Liu could guess the central command's intention—if it were just for a few old guns, they wouldn't risk the soldiers' lives in Mengjiang. More importantly, it's about seizing the opportunity to gather military intelligence from the inland and even incite some troops to revolt. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Thinking of this, Squad Leader Liu couldn't help but shout, 'Giddy up! Let's move faster, comrades!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu On the other side, Squad Leader Li was quite fearful. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu This wasn't Li's first time dealing in arms; he had sold to the Ma army and Gao Zongwu. But selling in Mengjiang was a first. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Brother, this is too risky. If the Japanese find out, they'll...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Have you heard the old saying?

Executing Wu Enkai is easy: write a notice, post it at the village gate, take him to the stage at a set time, and bang—it’s done. But then we face a few problems: first, we can’t hang his body at the village gate. It would rot, smell, and attract flies and insects, which could spread disease. Second, we can’t do the same things he did—how would that show we’re different?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wang Hao sipped his tea and nodded. \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'So, if we can’t hang it, we’ll have to bury it.

Second, in labor reform, everyone can supervise him. People can see if he’s working hard. Think about it, the hardships we endured, now he’ll endure them too, a thousand times over—if he slacks off and doesn’t meet the quota, he won’t have food, and we won’t give him extra. And if he tries any tricks, we can drag him back to the stage for another struggle session!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu This speech finally convinced Wang Hao.

He thought they would fail this time too, so he didn’t join the army or support the front.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But the Red Army was still the same Red Army. Even though he did nothing, the Red Army soldiers were still very kind to him, giving him the landlord’s property, encouraging him to join the village Soviet, exercise his sacred rights, and urging everyone to participate in mass movements to protect their own land.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu So Zhang Zemin felt it was time to make a change. He picked up his three guns and carefully polished them again. Then, holding the guns, he walked towards the village militia building."

Between the 1920s and 1940s, Ma Bufang gradually monopolized the wool industry and used it as a foundation to trade and purchase modern weapons to supply his army.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wool was the lifeblood of the Qinghai Ma family's economy, but when the Ma family suddenly collapsed, their various ranches suffered devastating blows.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The people can flee, but where can the pastures go?' The Red Army soldiers hadn’t yet entered the pasture when they heard an old man sighing helplessly in front of the pasture.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Old man, what happened?' A soldier, hearing the voice, quickly approached the elderly man sitting at the entrance, sighing, and asked.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The old man, who looked about sixty or seventy years old, shuddered when he saw a soldier coming, but after seeing the red star on the soldier's hat, he relaxed and said, 'What else? A bunch of heartless folks took the sheep and ran! Now, there aren’t many sheep left in the pasture!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Old man, what about the managers who were in charge before?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Ha! They led the escape! I can’t figure out where they think they can run to.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Old man, we are the team responsible for organizing the recovery of production in the pastoral area. Do you know how many livestock are left in this pasture, and where the fleeing managers might have taken the cattle and sheep?' The captain, who followed closely behind, asked the old man steadily.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Ha! This pasture belonged to the Ma family, and the livestock were also Ma's. The one who ran was also one of Ma's! These days, the herders didn’t dare come to the pasture either! They took quite a few cattle and sheep back to their own tribes. If my tribe hadn’t perished, I would have run too.' The old man said a lot in one breath. 'Looking at you, it seems you’re here to take over the pasture? You’re in luck; all the main managers have fled, so you can take over directly without much trouble.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Thank you, old man, but are there any herders left in the pasture? Our mission is to coordinate the herders to manage the cattle and sheep, with the income being split fifty-fifty between the herders and the pasture...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Before the words were finished, the old man’s eyes lit up, and he said:"

COX.132.d:"£gezifu £gezifu North of the rolling hills of the Northwest, across the grassy plateau, a weary army marches on. Unsure if the enemy still pursues them, the soldiers dare not rest or look back to bury their fallen comrades. Once proud members of the National Revolutionary Army, they are now a band of ragged fugitives, wielding worn-out rifles and dressed in tattered uniforms, fleeing like desperate outlaws.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Chiang Ching-kuo wonders when this ordeal will end.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Since his father's death, the united front has crumbled. His memories of those dark days are hazy, but he knows that the army scattered, and the country descended into chaos... China was finished. Swept along by a retreating army, he found himself in the vast Northwest—one of the few places untouched by the flames of war.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Upon hearing of his father's death, Chiang Ching-kuo was overwhelmed with grief and anger, eager to raise the banner of resistance once more. In Lanzhou, he was received by Ma Bufang. But aside from this cold reception, the Ma family, who ruled the Northwest, was unwilling to offer more. They 'invited' Chiang Ching-kuo to stay in Lanzhou, ostensibly to 'avoid the Japanese,’ but in reality, they kept him under house arrest.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu And so, time passed. The Ma family continued to monopolize trade in the Northwest, with the only difference being that their profits now came in yen. Wealth flowed into Ma Bufang's coffers, and Lanzhou’s nights were filled with endless revelry.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu For Chiang Ching-kuo, those were days of fantasy. The aroma of fine wine intoxicated him, the elegance of the socialites he mingled with captivated him, and the clinking of glasses made him forget the world outside. He began to feel as though he had returned to the bustling Shanghai Bund, or to the misty West Lake of Hangzhou. Under the invaders' flag, the Chinese people seemed to be enjoying what they had longed for over the past half-century—peace.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But as Chiang Ching-kuo, still drunk, stepped into the chilly late autumn night, he witnessed a different scene—a group of old soldiers lay across the street in Lanzhou. They were emaciated, their uniforms stained with the filth of human existence. Passersby averted their eyes, skirting around them as if avoiding a plague...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu This sight, coupled with the howling autumn wind, jolted Chiang Ching-kuo back to reality. He should have seen through the bloody reality hidden beneath the facade of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.' He should have stepped up to carry on his father's legacy. He should have fought alongside these soldiers, sacrificing himself on the road to bleeding for his country...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Shaking off the stench of alcohol, he walked with steady, determined steps."

If the liberated areas are already like this, then what about our comrades in the white areas? Over the past few years, disasters have been unrelenting, yet the traitorous Nationalist government’s taxes haven’t eased up one bit, forcing so many people, even at the risk of death, to flee over mountains and rivers to escape to the liberated areas... I often think, if we could just march back a little earlier, even just a day, how many lives could we save?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I fled from famine too, so I understand better than anyone...

Apart from the continuous post-war refugee influx, only a few bandits have been active near the provincial border, threatening the safety of the area.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Since taking over the government, the Communist Party has implemented a series of proactive measures to ensure border security.

COX.136.d:"£gezifu £gezifu The situation is urgent, leaving no room for delay. After receiving the alarming news from the border, the cadres stationed in Dihua unanimously agreed that immediate action was necessary. They grabbed chairs, spread out the scattered border reports on the table, and within half an hour, the solemn-faced cadres were gathered around a long table.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Refugees and attacks are increasing rapidly... Can the border hold?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Barely. Although we’ve taken measures to resettle refugees and protect settlements, the current level of pressure is overwhelming...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Even seasoned cadres, trained through land reform struggles, couldn’t quickly make sense of the chaotic and conflicting information from Qinghai, let alone devise a strategy. The meeting soon descended into a mild state of disorder.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'According to recent intelligence, the Ma army is engaged in a conflict on the eastern front with an unknown—possibly multiple—hostile forces.' Liu Shaoqi, seated against the wall, flipped through the documents on the table, dropping a bombshell on the meeting with his first statement. 'The Ma family has always kept a low profile during the Anti-Japanese War, and Qinghai remained one of the safest regions in the country after the war. But now, the number of people fleeing from Ma territory to Xinjiang has increased significantly, which contradicts what we knew.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Some of the recent refugees said the Ma army is fighting another army, while others mentioned battles with a group of rampaging bandits. Many also reported that a few months ago, the Ma army started collecting a “war tax,” which some claimed was for “anti-Japanese efforts,” though most people saw it as just another way for the government to make money,' added a cadre in charge of refugee management.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'This information confirms my suspicion.' Liu Shaoqi confidently concluded, 'I believe the Ma army is most likely fighting the Japanese.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The atmosphere in the meeting room grew heavy, and everyone recalled the horrors of the Anti-Japanese War over twenty years ago: the trampling of the imperial Japanese army, the rampant collaboration of traitors, and the cries of suffering laborers—all of it came rushing back.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The recent escalation of banditry in the east clearly shows that the Ma army is struggling to contain it. This indicates that their opponent is formidable, requiring the Ma army to commit most of its forces to the battle, leaving little to deal with the bandits. This makes sense.' Liu Shaoqi’s finger circled the eastern part of Qinghai on the map. 'First, let’s rule out the bandits; no bandit group could stand up to a local warlord without falling. Then, let’s rule out the Nanjing Nationalist government; they have no reason to attack the Ma family. The only remaining possibility is the Japanese.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The cadres began whispering among themselves, and Mao Anying overheard a few voices expressing reluctance to get involved in Ma’s affairs. After much thought, he finally spoke up: 'Comrades, quiet down and listen to me!' Once the room had settled, he continued: 'Since ancient times, the Hexi Corridor has been the gateway to Xinjiang. If we allow it to descend into chaos, it could be disastrous for the base area. In the worst-case scenario, if it falls into Japanese hands, the Xinjiang Soviet area would be exposed to the full brunt of Japanese imperialism, and the future of the revolution would be in grave danger. No matter what, we must intervene in the east, and we must be prepared to start another Anti-Japanese War as early as tomorrow.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I propose that we vote on whether to intervene,' Liu Shaoqi suggested.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After a brief debate and a round of questions, even those cadres who were initially hesitant about intervention changed their stance. The decision to intervene in Ma’s affairs was passed unanimously.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Given the uncertain situation, it would be best to send a working group to investigate and make preparations,' Liu Shaoqi proposed.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade Mao, let us veterans handle this task.' After some thought, Chen Yun stood up, 'We’ve fought the Japanese for over twenty years; we’ve seen worse than this!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Count me in,' Li Xiannian chimed in, 'I’ve tangled with the Ma army during the Western Expedition; I know their ways inside out...'"

He was a fifty-year-old man, the Minister of Industry and Electrification of the Soviet area. He was sitting with Huang Yanpei, the Minister of Light Industry for the Soviet area, both squatting under the wall, eating soaked bread. Quite a bit of plaster fell into their teacups.

After three days of rewiring and inspection, the electricians completed their task and stayed behind to educate the factory workers on electrical circuits.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Using heavy rechargeable batteries and simple circuit setups as teaching tools, these electricians brought what they could from the shores of Lake Baikal. In the unindustrialized Northwest, it was nearly impossible to find a second set of such equipment. But the electricians still used this teaching kit to teach the workers basic electrical knowledge.

Abdukerim Abasov, carrying a rifle barely in working condition, led his Mongolian horse at the head of the column.

At that time, he led the people of Xinjiang in rising up against the economic oppression of the Xinjiang authorities, joining forces with the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army in the East to overthrow Sheng Shicai’s rule. However, Sheng Shicai had no intention of cooperating. These defeated soldiers, desperate to find a foothold, launched a reckless attack. Under the bombardment, the revolutionary forces suffered heavy losses, and one of the leaders, Moslimov, was hit by shrapnel and tragically killed. Abasov had no choice but to abandon the county seat, leading the now-leaderless Gongha Guerrilla Detachment into the vast wilderness and desert to continue the fight. Guerrilla life was not something most could endure, and it was common for fighters to leave, taking their horses and guns with them. When Zedenbal contacted Abasov, hoping he would fight for the Mongolian People’s Front, this guerrilla force from Xinjiang had been reduced to just a few dozen men. In Ulaanbaatar, the guerrillas received new fighters and supplies, but their valiant efforts couldn’t change the fate of the People’s Front being defeated by the combined forces of Mengjiang and the Japanese army. Unwilling to give up, Abasov gathered his men and chose not to retreat with Zedenbal to the People's Revolutionary Committee's territory but returned to the Mongolian-Xinjiang border to continue their guerrilla warfare. This middle-aged man seemed to see his future: his fighters would leave one by one until only he remained. That is, unless he had not met that Red Army soldier from Xinjiang.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Sheng Shicai’s rule has been destroyed, and the Soviets welcome your return.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Should he trust this soldier? Abasov pondered for a long time. He vaguely remembered that the Chinese general and his troops, mentioned by the Red Army soldier, had recently followed Vasilevsky in blocking further aggression by Mengjiang. How they entered Xinjiang and established a red regime, the Red Army soldier did not say, and Abasov did not ask.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Perhaps it was time to return. A Xinjiang for the people had always been his dream, even now. He wanted to witness it with his own eyes. And besides, his men deserved to settle down.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The day after the Red Army soldier left, the Gongha Guerrilla Detachment made their decision—to go home.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Abasov raised his hand, signaling the column to halt. They were now only a few kilometers from the Xinjiang border. According to the Red Army soldier, the Soviets would send troops to meet them at the border and escort them into Xinjiang. He lifted his binoculars and looked into the distance."

COX.201.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Old Li was a veteran, having joined the army when the War of Resistance broke out. He retreated from Songhu to Nanjing, to Wuhan, to Chongqing, and finally ended up in Xinjiang. But how did such a legendary figure end up as just a platoon leader under Sheng Shicai?—Whenever a new recruit asked this, Old Li would always sidle over, holding a cheap cigarette he had skimmed off, revealing a mouthful of yellow teeth: 'No secret, just ran enough.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Surviving first, filling your belly second, and nothing more—that’s my life philosophy,' Old Li would say. As someone who’s been through it, he felt a responsibility to pass on his survival philosophy to the newer soldiers—'Being a soldier means being cowardly, never believe in what those in power say, believe it, and you’ll die. Back in Nanjing, Tang Shengzhi shouted ‘Sacrifice for the Party and Country’ a thousand times, but when the city was about to fall, he took a boat and fled, leaving hundreds of thousands to be slaughtered by the Japanese. Officers steal, extort, sell arms, and falsify military records. Can’t we soldiers do a bit of petty theft too?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Is everyone like this?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The whole of China is the same.' From the central army to the local forces, Old Li had served in almost all of them, so he could guarantee it, 'Just look close to home. Sheng Shicai’s men all shouted ‘Live and die with Dihua,’ but when the Communist army came, didn’t they all either scatter or surrender?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'And what about the Red Army?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Take a look at our food, do you see any extra fat?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu The Red flag now flew over the city walls, yet they were still eating coarse bread and bland soup. The new recruits, disheartened, had to admit that Old Li was right.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'As for the officers, they’re probably having their own feasts.' Old Li took a deep drag from his cigarette, laughing to himself, 'That guy with the surname Mao is probably holed up in some nice little building, getting served fried eggs and rice every day.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'So, according to you, being a soldier means no future, just scrounging for a meal, huh?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Selling your life for a meal, if you’re lucky enough to get fed, that’s what being a soldier is all about...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Before he could finish, a loud voice echoed through the camp, one that the new recruits vaguely recognized—it was the battalion commander’s voice.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrades, gather for a meeting!' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu ……\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Here is the public account of our battalion’s expenses for this month. After deducting expenditures, there’s over a hundred yuan left. If anyone needs anything by the end of the month, you can bring it up. If anyone needs to go to Dihua City, the battalion will arrange travel expenses...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I...I want to eat pork!' a new recruit timidly raised his hand.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'What are you thinking?' The commander immediately scolded, 'In these hard times in the base area, you still want pork?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The new recruit felt his head buzz, then his whole body started trembling with regret... In the old army, officers maintained their authority through fear, and punishing ‘troublemakers’ was the most common method.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu '—Let’s make do with a few pounds of lamb. Tell the mess hall to prepare lamb soup tonight...' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu Hearing there would be meat tonight, the entire battalion was buzzing with excitement.

COX.202.d:"£gezifu £gezifu In the old army, officers held absolute authority. In the reactionaries' rigid minds, the most important thing for a soldier was unwavering obedience to orders. They feared soldiers thinking for themselves and did everything they could to suppress any initiative.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Therefore, during the process of reforming the old army, it was essential to fully mobilize the soldiers' long-suppressed initiative. But this was no easy task—\n\n£gezifu £gezifu '...That’s all for today’s lesson. Does anyone have any questions?' \n\n£gezifu £gezifu He Xiaoshu scanned the room but saw only dull, blank expressions. If the soldiers hadn’t been forced to sit here, he was sure most of them would have left long ago. Faced with this situation, He Xiaoshu was at a loss. By Lake Baikal, he could command troops to ambush an NKVD convoy and complete the retreat before the enemy even reacted. But how to impart those experiences was beyond him.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Doesn’t anyone have any questions?' He Xiaoshu felt like he was talking to a group of wooden statues.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I do...' Finally, after his repeated urging, one soldier raised his hand. 'Sir... I’m just a soldier, a simple man. I don’t know how to fight, just how to follow orders... To be honest, these things are the officers’ duties, what use is it for us to learn them?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Finally, a breakthrough—\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'First of all... the Red Army doesn’t distinguish between officers and soldiers, only between commanders and fighters. Secondly, the Red Army is different from the old army. Warlords treat soldiers like cannon fodder, stepping on your corpses to achieve their own wealth and power. The new army is the people’s army; we must defeat imperialism, liberate the entire nation, and then return home alive to build a new society... In the old army, being a soldier meant selling your life to someone else, but in the new army, being a soldier means taking control of your own fate. Not only that, but we also have the responsibility of liberating the entire nation, and that’s no easy task! The Japanese have planes, tanks, artillery, and helicopters, while we have only millet and rifles. So what can we do? Everyone must think, not just the commanders but also every fighter.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After saying this, He Xiaoshu looked at the crowd—"

COX.203.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Remembering the past, the Chinese Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army was born from the river of blood that flowed from the Kuomintang’s butcher's knife. At first glance, with their outdated rifles, it seemed like just another ordinary warlord’s force in China. But it was this army that stood firm against enemies ten times their size, that could march across thousands of miles without disbanding, and that, in the face of the nation’s life-or-death crisis, served as the pillar that slowed the enemy’s advance in the vast rear areas...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu So what made the Red Army the Red Army?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Was it the absolute leadership of the Party?—No, any warlord knew to keep a tight grip on military power.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Was it the guerrilla tactics of striking where the enemy was weak?—No, to wage guerrilla warfare, a powerful cohesion was already needed.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As he reviewed the ranks, mainly composed of former warlord troops, Mao Anying was deep in thought. Each person in the ranks held an old rifle, no different from before, and the formations were not particularly neat, but every person stood tall. Mao Anying recalled how, during the liberation of Xinjiang, these men had been captured like headless chickens, and when Sheng Shicai’s regime collapsed, not one of them was willing to continue fighting. They surrendered in full regiments, and when the Red Army decided to incorporate them, they accepted the reorganization without hesitation.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Being part of a warlord’s army—an old military force—was indeed a miserable fate. One day you might be fighting the Beiyang Army under the Central Army’s orders, and the next day you’d be fighting the Shanxi Army under Beiyang’s command. Changing flags was a common occurrence. But this didn’t mean Chinese soldiers were inherently corrupt—during the War of Resistance, millions of soldiers were rallied by the call to save the nation, and in the face of national crisis, countless Chinese made sacrifices that could be sung about for ages. But the corrupt bureaucrats and warlords treated such sacrifices as things to be manipulated and desecrated at will. When the front lines were critical, they would cower in the safety of the rear, profiting from the precious supplies. When the troops retreated, they would exploit the soldiers’ patriotic fervor, pretending they would ‘one day counterattack’ to maintain their control over their little fiefdoms. Such heartfelt dedication led to soldiers being sent far from home, fighting to the death without the hope of even a half-day’s rest. No wonder they became disheartened, eventually turning into bandits or soldier ruffians.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But within the Red Army, these once-disheartened soldiers found new life.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The Red Army brought liberation and swept away oppression—it was the people’s army. That is why Red Army soldiers fought with unwavering faith on the most difficult battlefields and endured the heaviest losses. Looking at the newly assembled troops, Mao Anying thought: These soldiers, who once fought in the national liberation war, were always Red Army soldiers. It was only the darkness of the old society that dimmed their ideals. In the upcoming war, they will surely become the backbone of the new Red Army."

When the host described how the National Protection Army raised the flag over the Presidential Palace, tears welled up in Mao Anying’s eyes.

COX.206.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Lanzhou, abbreviated as 'Lan' or 'Gao,' was historically known as Jincheng. Situated in a strategic location in the northwest, Lanzhou has a history of over two thousand years, dating back to the Qin Dynasty. It has always been a transportation hub and military stronghold, connecting the four corners of the realm. When the Japanese expeditionary forces occupied Lanzhou, Tsuji Masanobu keenly recognized its strategic importance and, with reinforcements from Manchuria, fortified the city with steel and concrete, conscripting local labor to surround Lanzhou with an impenetrable ironclad fortress.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But no matter how strong the fortifications, they had their weaknesses. As the war dragged on, Tsuji Masanobu found it increasingly difficult to secure supplies and reinforcements for the expeditionary forces. The troops were exhausted and could no longer maintain pressure on Xining as before. The protracted war wore down the patience of the Empire, and every week, Tsuji Masanobu received telegrams from headquarters urging him to withdraw. However, the spirit of the Empire kept him fighting, standing firm with his sword until death, hoping for a turn of events.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The activities of the guerrillas severely restricted the movements of the expeditionary forces in the countryside. Lacking manpower and short on supplies, Tsuji Masanobu ordered his soldiers to hold only a few large settlements. This left them unprepared for the Red Army's offensive, which swiftly removed several outposts in a matter of days, completely surrounding Lanzhou.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Even then, Tsuji Masanobu clung to his delusions—if Lanzhou's strong walls could blunt the Red Army's momentum, the expeditionary forces could counterattack and crush the resistance in the northwest, allowing him to return home as a hero of the Empire...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Thus began the brutal siege. Concerned about damaging Lanzhou's historic sites and harming innocent civilians, the Red Army refrained from using heavy artillery. Instead, they launched waves of assaults on the city's defenses with the support of mountain artillery and heavy machine guns. After some casualties, the Red Army captured the Japanese positions outside the city, forcing the enemy to retreat within the walls. What awaited the Red Army inside was an even more savage battle—fortified barricades filled the once-bustling streets, and higher residential buildings were turned into strongholds. The Japanese soldiers, indifferent to civilian casualties, forced the remaining residents to surrender their last grains and sweat under the threat of bayonets, using them as human shields to inflict heavy losses on the Red Army, who had to clear each building one by one...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The fierce fighting in the city continued for weeks. By the time the dust settled, Lanzhou was left scarred and battered. As if the destruction from the battle wasn't enough, the Japanese rear guard set fire to the city before retreating, and the flames spread across several districts...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The battle to drive the Japanese out of Lanzhou cost the Chinese people countless lives..."

His hometown was in Shandong, and under the Japanese bayonets, he was just a boy not even old enough to chew pancakes when his father tied him on his back and fled westward, settling in Xi’an. But how could these refugees escape faster than the advancing Japanese troops? Within a year, the Japanese reached the walls of Xi’an. During the ensuing chaos, fourteen-year-old Liu slipped through a doghole at the base of the city wall and ran into the mountains, eventually stumbling upon a bandit camp. The bandits, seeing he had no family left, took him in.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As the bandits raided and plundered, young Liu followed along, carrying nothing but a stick. When the Japanese captured Chongqing, they began a furious campaign to clear out Shaanxi. The ill-equipped local forces and bandits were no match for the well-armed Japanese troops. Liu watched from afar as the camp was consumed in a massive fire, threw his rifle into a pit, and fled north. He mixed in with refugee groups, wandering for over a year before finding his way to Ma Hongkui’s territory. Ma gave him a Hanyang rifle and sent him to stand guard on the border with other recruits his age. Though they still lived on wild vegetables and pig fodder, at least they had a place to sleep safely.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The post-war years were calm and uneventful. There were few internal conflicts among Ma’s troops, and after the war ended, soldiers like Liu had no role left to play. However, during those years, he grew from a naive boy into a shrewd soldier. He also perfected an almost indistinguishable northwest accent, which allowed him to find ways to supplement his income whenever his pay was insufficient, often at the expense of fellow refugees.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu In 1960, Japanese tanks rolled across the provincial border, and Lanzhou fell almost instantly, with Ma’s 100,000 troops collapsing within moments.

The front lines were about to see combat, and they couldn’t afford to produce too few weapons. So what could they do? At first, they just worked overtime, each person doing the work of two. But that wasn’t sustainable. People aren’t machines that can be fixed by replacing parts. So the factory director called a meeting, urging everyone to think of ways to improve production efficiency.

But today, everyone seemed to be in a hurry, arriving early at the commune gate, afraid... afraid they wouldn't make it in time!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As Qian Manyi continued to tally the numbers on his abacus and scribbled on paper, his movements almost sparked a fire! But suddenly, he paused, raising his head to look at Saimaiti, the towering man in front of him, who nodded in acknowledgment.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Saimaiti! Why are you delivering so much this time?' In the noisy commune, Qian Manyi had to shout. He knew all the commune members and was familiar with their usual grain delivery amounts after keeping the books for several years. Saimaiti's delivery was unusually large this time, far exceeding his usual contribution. 'Did you accidentally include some of your household's grain?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The sturdy Saimaiti blushed at this and responded in halting Chinese, 'This is for fighting the devils... I discussed it with my wife... We decided to contribute more to the anti-Japanese effort...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Qian Manyi was stunned: 'But what about your food supply...?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Don't worry! We've planned it out!' Saimaiti reassured him before leaving. Qian Manyi continued his work, noticing that Saimaiti wasn't the only one; many others were also doing their part to support the Soviet area and the anti-Japanese effort.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu At the end of the day, Qian Manyi looked at the granary. He knew that soon, this grain would be loaded onto military trains, sent to the front lines, into the trenches, and into the hands of the soldiers. Reflecting on the day's work, Qian Manyi murmured:"

He had only joined the army because his business went bankrupt and he needed a way to make a living.

COX.217.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Horimura Akio followed his unit through the countryside of North China, conducting the Japanese army's 'regular inspections.' Ever since martial law was imposed in North China, these patrols had become more frequent. The North China Army and the Japanese forces had woven a tight net, but the anti-Japanese resistance was spreading like a malignant tumor across the region. The command had to increase patrols, replacing the ineffective North China Army with Japanese troops. Horimura Akio hadn't had a half-day of rest in weeks; every day was a grueling journey, whether by car or on foot—patrolling villages in North China, searching for any traces of 'anti-Japanese elements.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu First, the villagers' attitudes grew colder, and then the orders for more 'inspections' increased, making everyone groan—who wanted to be out here, walking all day? The 'anti-Japanese elements' were multiplying, but they were hard to catch. Still, they couldn't do much damage to the Imperial Army, so things just dragged on.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Enemy sighted! Full unit, pursue!' Horimura Akio was lost in thought when his officer's shout snapped him back to attention. Enemy sighted? Pursue! He immediately started running with his comrades (after all, physical fitness was heavily emphasized in training), but they were unfamiliar with the terrain, and the 'enemy' quickly vanished after a few maneuvers. Just as Horimura Akio was feeling dejected, a gunshot rang out—'Enemy attack! Stay alert!' He quickly coordinated with his teammates, following the drills they'd practiced, but the gunshot was a one-off, nothing more. 'Is this place haunted?' Horimura Akio wondered—'Bang!' Another shot! And this time, the shooting was continuous. 'Over there!' The squad leader realized, and the sound of gunfire suggested there were quite a few people. He split the unit into two, taking one group to pursue while leaving the others to guard their position. Horimura Akio followed the squad leader in the chase. 'Bang-bang-bang,' the gunfire got closer, with some bullets even whizzing past Horimura Akio's ears, but when they arrived, the enemy was gone, leaving only spent shell casings behind. The squad leader was furious, swearing to—'Bang!' Gunfire! Back at the guard post! They rushed back, but it was too late—Horimura Akio found only the bodies of his fallen comrades.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Ah, these devils' cigarettes are much stronger,' Dong Shan remarked contentedly as he smoked one of the cigarettes looted from the enemy today, exhaling a long puff. 'Not frustrated anymore, huh?' Old Kong said, smiling beside him. 'How could I be? I have to admit, Old Kong, your old method really worked!' Dong Shan replied.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Of course,' Old Kong continued looking up at the sky, 'this method, my dad told me, was taught to him by an Eighth Route Army soldier. That soldier later died in battle and was buried in our village. We were so scared of the devils back then that we didn't even dare to put up a gravestone. Now, we don't even know where his grave is.

The Communist Party introduced tractors in Xinjiang and set up tractor stations in various agricultural areas. Maimaiti seized the opportunity and attended a training class at the tractor station to learn how to drive a tractor.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A few years had passed, and Maimaiti's life had greatly improved. He was grateful to the Communist Party and had even joined the Party after embracing Marxism. Just a few days ago, Maimaiti heeded the Party's call and joined the anti-Japanese ranks. But what was he good at? Maimaiti didn't know how to shoot, but he knew how to drive a tractor!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Old leader, I'm good at driving tractors, so I can learn to drive trucks quickly.' Maimaiti said in his newly learned Chinese.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade Maimaiti, the organization appreciates your skills, and everyone acknowledges your learning ability. So, how about joining our newly formed truck team to deliver weapons to the front lines?' The leader replied in Uyghur, establishing a sense of respect and equality.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Maimaiti had expected to see more greenery on the roads of Qinghai, but it wasn't much different from his hometown. Departing from Hami, Maimaiti took turns driving with his Han comrade Liu Shaoan. They alternated driving and sleeping in the passenger seat, but they also had time to chat.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Where did these trucks come from? I've never seen them before.' Liu Shaoan asked.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Well, I think these trucks came from Urumqi. They brought them in from Kazakhstan... some kind of... factory production line...' Maimaiti struggled to find the Chinese words.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Industrial production line?' Liu Shaoan offered.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, yes! That's it! And some of the trucks were bought from the Russians.' Maimaiti continued driving, noticing something in the sky ahead that looked like a bird.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Comrade, take a look over there. What is that?' Maimaiti asked.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Damn, it's a plane.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Maimaiti, quick, quick, drive behind that rock on the left!' Liu Shaoan shouted.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu With a burst of speed, Maimaiti drove behind the rock. But not all the trucks in the convoy were so lucky. The Japanese, with their limited aircraft in the northwest theater, could still cause casualties on this vital supply line.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'The Japanese are really ruthless. If they sent a few more planes, our convoy would be wiped out!' Maimaiti cursed loudly.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After a smoke break by the roadside, Maimaiti and Liu Shaoan continued with the convoy, transporting the essential supplies for the anti-Japanese effort."

Tinch!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The workers fell silent as Yasenjiang asked the factory commissar Zhong Wansheng what was going on. Zhong Wansheng pointed to Aikesenjiang, who had been tied up and said, 'Our factory has had problems with the tracks and engines produced recently. Alimu and Wu Han were on the night shift yesterday and caught him sabotaging the equipment.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But Yasenjiang was not surprised. Aikesenjiang had been a refugee from Kazakhstan, and they had kept him at the factory because of his previous work experience. However, Yasenjiang had always suspected his identity, thinking he might be a Pan-Turkist, despite Ahemaitijiang's efforts to eradicate such thoughts through his articles.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Get the comrades from the Security Bureau here and tell them I'll pretend to let him go, then follow him to find his contacts.' Yasenjiang had always been cautious. The Security Bureau had wanted him to join, but he felt his production work was more important, so he became the factory director instead.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Is it wise to let him go?' Wu Han had some concerns, not without reason, as capturing one spy was still a victory. 'Don't worry, I've been looking after him, so he won't be suspicious. Exchanging one spy for an entire network is worth it.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Aikesenjiang was secretly pleased after being released, thinking he had escaped capture. Little did he know he was under surveillance. He hurried to a noodle shop in the city and used a code to contact a Japanese agent. 'The factory director let me go,' Aikesenjiang whispered in Uyghur. 'But you're no longer useful.' The Japanese agent poisoned his tea, believing that keeping him alive would only increase the risk of exposure.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Suddenly, someone burst through the restaurant door, shouting, 'Don't move! You're under arrest!' The agent quickly tried to figure out how he had been caught. Was it the murder? No, Aikesenjiang and he had been sitting apart at different tables, so it couldn't have aroused suspicion. Was it because he had exposed himself?

No one expected this defeated army would soon sweep across the south and liberate Nanjing.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu During that time, Ye Jianying, along with remnants of the CCP hiding in North Vietnam, followed the National Protection Army into the war. As a celebrated anti-Japanese general recognized by both the KMT and CCP, he was naturally invited by Long Yun to serve as the Chief of Staff of the National Protection Army's headquarters.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Another Chief of Staff!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Over twenty years ago, he was also the Chief of Staff of the Red Army in Shaanxi. He recalled the days when that barren land was full of revolutionary zeal—people engaged in land reform, production, and fought against the enemy. But as the war turned against them, and the Shanxi warlords switched sides, the weakened base was forced to confront the enemy's assault. The Party Central Committee had to embark on a new Long March, leaving behind those who stayed in Shaanxi to defend the base with their lives.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu To preserve the revolution, the Party searched for a new anti-Japanese base. Under the relentless pursuit of the Japanese, the Eighth Route Army crossed the devastated lands of China, scaling the Qinling Mountains and crossing the Sichuan Basin. The army's size dwindled, and the CCP paid a heavy price, even losing the man who had led the Party through perilous times over the past twenty years. A stray bullet took his life—a cruel twist of fate... By the time the remaining communists reached Yunnan, the Party was in shambles—the leadership either scattered or dead along the way. Ye Jianying never imagined that the task of leading the southern survivors would ultimately fall on his shoulders.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu In the jungles of North Vietnam, surviving was harder than fighting. The harsh conditions caused illness among the northern troops, but the jungle provided excellent cover for guerrilla operations, and the enemy's oppression fueled widespread popular support. The communist guerrillas took root here and grew over twenty years. But Ye Jianying never stopped thinking about the comrades who had stayed in Shaanxi and those who had scattered across the country.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu With Long Yun's launch of the Second Northern Expedition, his questions were finally answered—\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The comrades who stayed in Shaanxi had survived against all odds, enduring twenty years of Japanese and puppet army attacks. They survived in the gaps between warlords and bandits. Not only that, but when Ye Jianying learned that the entire Northwest was now under communist control, he was so overwhelmed with emotion that he could barely speak.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Chief Ye,' a soldier knocked on his office door.

Even after being here for some time, Ye Jianying couldn't get used to the opulence—just the parlor was large enough to fit an entire platoon for drills, with elegant chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, scattering the light of incandescent bulbs into every corner of the room.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu In the past, the 'presidents' of the reformed national government would meet with diplomats from within and outside the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere here. Despite the large floor-to-ceiling windows being cleverly angled toward the courtyard, one could still see the sprawling slums that had sprung up around Nanjing in recent years if the curtains weren't carefully drawn.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu During the siege of Nanjing, this place became a battlefield. After the former 'President' of the Republic of China, Gao Zongwu, took his own life here, the National Protection Army removed most of the luxurious decorations along with the curtains that once served as a facade. Long Yun had his favorite sofa from Yunnan brought in, and overnight, this place became the headquarters of China's resistance forces.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu At this moment, Ye Jianying saw Long Yun—the leader of the National Protection Army, the embodiment of the nation's anti-Japanese spirit—engaged in conversation with a middle-aged man.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu '...The people of the Northwest are willing to do everything in their power to form a united front with your forces, to jointly pursue the great cause of national liberation.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Good... good!' Despite being over eighty, Long Yun was still vigorous, standing up to point at the map showing the jagged front lines. 'As you can see, although anti-Japanese forces are spread across the south of the Yangtze, the Japanese occupation of Guangdong and North China still poses a pincer threat to us. The warlords are indecisive, and it remains uncertain whether they will fully commit to the resistance—this is the most dangerous time for our nation... But if the provinces of the Northwest join us, it will greatly ease the military pressure on the long front line in North China and politically, it could secure victory...'"\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Northwest government? The Communist Party? Hearing these terms left Ye Jianying a bit bewildered—this envoy who received an audience with Long Yun must be a leader of the Northwest Party organization. He expected to see an older comrade but was surprised to see a young face he had never met.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Ah, General Ye is here,' Long Yun turned to the middle-aged man and continued, 'This is General Ye Jianying, also a member of your Communist Party. He led the communists in Yunnan in guerrilla warfare for twenty years.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I've long heard of your great name, Comrade Ye Jianying. I am Mao Anying, leader of the Northwest Anti-Japanese Government.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Mao Anying... Could it be...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, since my father's death, many things have happened. But twenty years later, communists are once again fighting on the anti-Japanese battlefield. For twenty years, you have fought for the people—I have heard all about it... Comrade, you have truly endured hardships.' Mao Anying extended his hand to the weathered warrior.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Years of exhaustion and pain seemed to surge forth in that moment, but Ye Jianying held back his emotions—there were still many barriers between the newly reborn Nanjing and the Northwest government. The military threat from the Japanese was imminent, time was short, and whether all of China's anti-Japanese forces could unite depended on whether he and his comrades in the Southwest could bridge the gap between Ürümqi and Nanjing.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Standing by, Long Yun grinned and said:"

Their brows furrowed even more...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu These slogans had spread like wildfire across the two provinces of Shanxi and Shandong along with the Red Army guerrillas. The 'Peace Army' kept defacing, scraping, and tearing them down, but the slogans kept reappearing, like spring flowers blooming after a breeze.

'Maybe we should surrender,' a few soldiers muttered from the back. The platoon leader sat grim-faced, a cigarette burning in his hand, sweat dripping down his forehead. The overseer, hearing this, immediately stood up, drew his Mauser, and aimed it at the platoon leader. He knew that his body was weighed down with blood debts, and if they surrendered, his fate would be to be beaten to death by the local peasants. With this thought, he swept his gun over the crowd, but it was clear he wasn't intimidating anyone—the situation was spiraling out of control. A deafening 'Bang!' silenced all arguments. Everyone looked at the source of the gunshot, where fresh blood stained the floor. The platoon leader had drawn his pistol and shot the overseer, the gun still smoking. 'Fall in! Form two lines, raise your rifles, and surrender to the Communist forces outside!' he commanded.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Outside the tower, the guerrillas crouched low, their captain anxiously watching his watch as time ticked by.

Li Er stood up, patted the dust off his pants, and headed back to the liaison office, where he and his comrades had gathered all the intel and details on Yulin. It would be crucial for the Red Army's takeover and stabilization efforts. He shuffled along the street, casually, passing shops where the old flags were being taken down and replaced with the red flag; he saw pedestrians eyeing the Red Army with a mix of awe and fear; he saw children running with pinwheels by the soldiers, only to be pulled back by their mothers...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu There's still a long way to go... Li Er thought helplessly. The people of Yulin had been abused by soldiers for so long that they had a deep-seated fear of any military force. He hoped the Red Army could change that perception, just as it had changed his.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Uncle Li!' Li Er heard a shout and felt a sharp slap on his back. 'Damn it... you little rascal!

No discipline, not afraid of being thrown in the brig?' 'I reported to the captain, and he approved it! Hey, Uncle Li, you've been in Yulin for a while now. How does life here compare to ours back home?' The young soldier was clearly more interested in something else.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Life... well...'

COX.231.d:"£gezifu £gezifu Northwest War Zone Command Reference:\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After the liberation of Lanzhou, our Northwest Bureau organized five batches of a total of 862 officers and soldiers to infiltrate Northern Shaanxi. The situation in Shaanxi turned out to be quite different from what we had anticipated. The Jin-Sui Autonomous Government seems to have not established an effective administrative body here, or rather, a loose tax farming system had existed here, but by now, any form of "rule" has completely collapsed, leaving the area in a state of total anarchy. Every village and town we passed through is isolated from information, and they have no idea what has happened to the Shanxi warlords who were supposed to rule this area. The vast undeveloped lands are now overrun with bandits and marauders. People seem unaccustomed to the chaos, and many large settlements that cannot sustain themselves have fallen into varying degrees of famine due to road closures.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The Jin-Sui Government's rule in northern Shaanxi, bordering the Mongolian region, was the first to collapse. According to local residents, during "peaceful times," this area was already a hotbed of banditry and rebellion, but amidst the current turmoil, basic production order has been maintained. Local villagers generally say that it is the "Red Army" active nearby that has protected them from the bandits. This greatly piqued our interest— the Northwest Bureau has never dispatched soldiers to Northern Shaanxi. When asked, the Central Committee also did not mention any organized Communist activities here. Thus, we dispatched the largest search party, carrying supplies and ammunition, to delve deeper into the Loess Plateau.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After two weeks of searching, we finally found this long-lost Red Army— in fact, due to a decade of encirclement by Japanese imperialism and its lackeys, the Red Army in Northern Shaanxi has not been able to establish any stable base area, and could only engage in guerrilla warfare with "small units" of less than a hundred people. Each unit covers a wide area and maintains contact with each other only through codewords and fixed meeting points. They know no more about the situation with the Jin faction warlords than we do; they only know that just a few months ago, the authorities were still propagandizing the need to "actively cooperate" with the Japanese military's martial law in North China and resolutely suppress all "rebellion endangering the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Combining all evidence, we have come to the following conclusion: Whatever the original cause, the Jin faction warlords' rule in Shaanxi has collapsed. It can be expected that the Japanese military's plan is to take over Shanxi for defense, but the whereabouts of the former Jin-Sui Military-Political Committee Chairman, Fu Zuoyi, remain unknown..."

The village had about twenty households, eking out a hard existence on this rugged northern land. To the people here, the arrival of outsiders always meant trouble—they were often desperate soldiers or bandits, or local enforcers from the county who came to collect 'voluntary donations.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The villagers had no idea what changes were happening in the world beyond the mountains, but it had been a long time since the enforcers last came. On this day, several soldiers suddenly appeared on the village's earthen wall, covered in dust and looking more weathered than the dead trees at the village entrance. Though worried about the identity of the newcomers, the farmers, who had just finished a day of dull labor, still huddled by their cave entrances, staring intently at the visitors.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Fellow villagers, we are the Red Army!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A voice, thick with the Shaanxi accent, stirred Wang Shunxi's memories of participating in military training in Nanniwan. He was about to get up and open the door when his wife grabbed his sleeve, 'Old Wang, do you want to die?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'But they said they are the Red Army...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'People from the county said the Red Army was wiped out long ago.

Chairman Mao said so...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Oh, I'm so unlucky to have married such a pauper... hardworking but brainwashed by the Communists... Go if you must, just don't touch our winter grain.' His wife let go and rushed into the kitchen, slamming the latch shut.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wang Shunxi stumbled out the door, the north wind stinging his face. He looked back and saw the eyes in the caves all fixed on him—the villagers were waiting to see what kind of fool the 'red element' in the village would make of himself. He looked at the soldiers, trembling as he asked:\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Are... are you really the Red Army? The Communist... army?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Yes, the national counterattack has already begun. The Party is about to return to Northern Shaanxi... Fellow villager, please believe us, this time we will definitely drive the Japanese out of China!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Looking at the Red Flag fluttering in the wind and the soldiers standing tall under it, he remembered the past. He was convinced they were indeed the Red Army. For over a decade, wave after wave of armies and bandits had passed through here, but only the Red Army had this spirit. Wang Shunxi, overwhelmed with emotion, could barely speak. He just stood as straight as he could, saluted, and then pulled out a piece of paper from his hidden pocket, 'This is my Party membership certificate, I had to throw away the cover because it was too conspicuous, but I kept the inside...'

Mao Anying handed Tsedenbal a document, 'After all, we both know that being away from home is never a good feeling.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Tsedenbal took the document and read it carefully, then breathed a sigh of relief. The document was largely about military cooperation and exchange between the People's Army and the Red Army, with no mention of China's claim to Outer Mongolia. Tsedenbal had been worried that Mao Anying would take this opportunity to reclaim sovereignty over Outer Mongolia.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Our current plan,' Mao Anying began to explain the upcoming military deployments, 'is to begin operations in Mongolia once preparations are complete.

The work team and the Peasant Workers' Association were constantly visited by streams of people, day and night. The chat sessions often led to cries, as people would remember the evil deeds the lords had done, and in talking about it, those who were crippled here and there would cry loudly. When the land was being distributed, Momin, who had been driven away by the Bayi lord, returned home from his small shack by the mountain. Hoja, who could only wear tattered clothes, happily ran around the village holding his land deed.

At the conference, it was announced that this conflict was provoked by the so-called 'People's Revolutionary Committee' from the Russian region along the border. With the cooperation of the Mongolian Army and the Japanese Air Force, the enemy was completely defeated. This victory once again demonstrated the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, proving the unity of Pan-Asian races in defeating their enemies... However, according to frontline soldiers, there were also a significant number of East Asian faces among the Red Army, including a unit known as the 'Chinese Brigade,' whose cunning tactics and skilled combat left a deep impression on those who encountered them.\n\nThe Japanese Empire's official stance was to firmly deny such claims."

COX_news_event.2.d:0 "In the remote regions of northwestern China, a bloody war aimed at eradicating the ghosts of the former Republic of China continues.\n\nInitially, the Imperial Expeditionary Force quickly conquered Lanzhou and killed the bandit leader Ma Bufang. The Imperial Army thought this would be another easy victory, but the local resistance far exceeded their expectations. On the vast wastelands outside Lanzhou, Japanese patrols were constantly harassed by various guerrilla groups. Due to the long supply lines, the reinforcements sent from Tokyo were subject to all sorts of losses, leaving them severely strained.\n\nThe poorly equipped Japanese soldiers, facing determined Chinese guerrillas, found themselves in a conflict that increasingly resembled the previous war, only twenty years later. However, in a recent sweep, the Japanese army finally managed to temporarily defeat the main force of the guerrillas. General Tsujimasa immediately assembled a large force to march on Xining. To this 'mad dog' general, the Battle of Xining was to be the turning point of this bloody war, with another great victory for the Empire within reach. Meanwhile, Ma Jiyuan, the son of Ma Bufang, reorganized the remnants of the Qinghai forces and built a strong defense in Xining, resisting the Japanese assault. Just as the Japanese were halted at the gates of Xining, the guerrillas launched a large-scale attack. With the risk of their supply lines being completely cut off, Tsujimasa had no choice but to order a retreat back to Lanzhou. The Imperial Army suffered a humiliating defeat beneath the walls of Xining."

Just as Japanese scientists were trying to explain it as a meteor impact, an aurora phenomenon, or a Chinese nuclear test, the phenomenon abruptly disappeared. Along with it, the million-strong army confronting the Japanese on the Korean front also vanished.\n\nIt had only been a few months since the Chinese Communist Party suddenly surged out of Xinjiang. In that time, the Chinese army had broken through Beijing, stormed into Nanjing, and nearly driven Japanese forces out of the mainland. At the Yalu River, where they should have continued their advance, they suddenly stopped. Then, every Chinese person heard a resolute voice in their minds, with a Xiangxi accent—'The People's Republic of China, Central People's Government, is established today!'\n\nThe world held its breath, waiting to see how this newly founded 'People's Republic' would affect the political landscape. But with today's burst of light, the powerful Red Army vanished, along with part of the Communist Party leadership.

The warlord also called on all the oppressed peoples of the Asian continent under Japanese rule to unite with them in attacking Japan.

 XBJ.1.d:0 "£gezifu £gezifu Li Er wore tattered burlap clothes, leaned on a stick he found by the roadside, and carried a broken bowl as he walked briskly across the desolate land of Qinghai.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He was supposed to limp to avoid being recognized as anything other than a beggar, but who cared? He had walked ten miles without seeing a single living soul, passing by two deserted villages where even the dogs had disappeared. Initially, he had planned to follow the captain’s orders and conduct a thorough investigation—what investigation? There wasn’t even fifty words to write! \n\n£gezifu £gezifu When the captain asked if anyone was familiar with Qinghai and the Ma family army, he hadn’t responded, but the new recruit next to him was the first to raise his hand—on Li Er’s behalf.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘Brother Li served as a soldier in Qinghai! He’s been a soldier in many places!’\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘You little brat…’ Li Er quickly tried to retract his hand, but it was too late. The captain’s gaze had already turned toward him, and even the ‘special envoy’ from above lit up at the sight.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After selecting a few more people, everyone received ten days of training, along with a special ten-day feast at the camp, deepening their understanding of ‘executing infiltration missions.’\n\n£gezifu £gezifu —After walking a few more miles, Li Er saw smoke in the distance. Great! Where there’s smoke, there are people! He quickly shifted from his brisk pace to a slow, limping shuffle.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As soon as he entered the village, he was too embarrassed to beg: there were two dead bodies lying at the entrance; as he went further in, people were slumped in front of every house—they were gaunt and pale, their heads either leaning against doorframes or hanging down, too weak even to lift their heads to look at Li Er as he passed by—maybe they didn’t even have the strength to turn their heads.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘Dear Lord…’ Although Li Er had seen many destitute households in previous wars, this was the worst he’d ever seen. Some families didn’t have a stitch of clothing, completely naked! Their bodies were emaciated, eye sockets sunken, ribs protruding… Heaven, just looking at them was enough to give him nightmares for days!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He headed toward the only house with smoke. ‘This one should be better,’ he thought.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He knocked on the half-closed door, quietly wailing for alms, but the only response was silence. He knocked again, still no response; so he boldly pushed the door open. Inside, he saw a woman slumped by the stove, dressed like someone from a well-off family—though it was just a tattered piece of clothing—clutching something in her hand. He hesitated, seemingly startled, then left the place of trouble.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu That evening, after a day of ‘investigation,’ he found a secluded spot to change his clothes, returned to the ‘contact point’ set up by his superiors, and began to write his report. He closed his eyes, recalling what he had seen that day, and two streams of murky tears rolled down his face."

As soon as they heard someone was distributing food, the entire town practically mobilized, rushing to grab this heaven-sent grain. Thousands of people swarmed in; the new recruit’s squad was like a drop in the ocean, utterly ineffective. The women comrades in the porridge station were sweating as they tended to the thick porridge, struggling to distribute it to the residents, but the hungry crowd was nearly overwhelming the station. Luckily, another platoon rushed in to help, and the new recruit and his squad barely managed to maintain order.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After three hours of chaos, the crowd finally dispersed, leaving only a few elderly women and children who cautiously approached, peeking into the pot of rice soup and sighing that they hadn’t made it in time. The comrades at the porridge station, of course, were prepared and took out the cold porridge they had set aside, reheating it and giving it to them.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The new recruit was naturally exhausted, slumping to the ground. He really wanted a cigarette, but he didn’t smoke.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘Sigh… what kind of work is this…’ The new recruit watched the people scrambling for porridge, as if seeing his former self, struggling to get by meal to meal. But he was even more frustrated with the ungratefulness of this hungry crowd—they all took the porridge but then went on to bow to the heavens and pray to Buddha, humph, superstitious fools!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘These ungrateful wretches, we’re the ones giving them food! If you ask me, we should just let them starve… Ouch!’\n\n£gezifu £gezifu His head was suddenly hit hard.

They had also managed to extort a large sum of money from someone who came out of nowhere. Ma Jin had planned to flee in a few days—but the communist bandits moved too fast! Yesterday, the county magistrate was killed right in front of the county office. As soon as he got out of the car, a man suddenly charged in on horseback and shot him dead with two bullets… Well, he deserved it; the communists had sent a lot of money, but he wanted double! The security chief fled in the middle of the night, leaving Ma Jin with no way to make peace with the communists. Rumor had it that the communists were about to arrive!

Ma Jin knew all too well what he had done!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Ma Jin packed his things, changed his clothes, and rushed out of the barracks. The street was as calm as ever; people seemed completely unaware of the surrounding changes, continuing to live their lives in a numb routine. Ma Jin tried not to draw attention, but the large bundle on his back was too conspicuous. Many people stared at him along the way, making his heart race. He had to quicken his pace, but not too much! If anyone realized he was fleeing, he’d be finished!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He was almost at the city gate, just had to cross this alley and…\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Suddenly, Ma Jin felt something press against his waist. A familiar voice, tinged with amusement, said, ‘Master Jin, what’s going on? Weren’t you supposed to open the city gates, and the Red Army would spare your life? Why are you sneaking away?’ Cold sweat broke out on Ma Jin’s forehead, and his bundle fell to the ground with a ‘thud.’\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Er stepped out from behind him, followed by two soldiers in blue uniforms, their guns pointed at Ma Jin.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Li Er looked at Ma Jin’s despairing face, on the verge of tears, and remembered how arrogant he had been not long ago.

Breakfast was usually just a few slices of radish, dinner was thin porridge, and lunch? What lunch? Could someone like him even afford that...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He had lived this way for fifteen years.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Fifteen years! It had turned a man who fled from the mainland into a frail, skeleton-like wretch! Here, he had worked for that landlord for fifteen years, and in the end, all he got was a full belly. After herding livestock for fifteen years, what did he get? Not even a bite of meat!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu When the communist bandits came, his master naturally planned to flee.

But his master kicked him off the cart.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘You filthy herder, how dare you try to come with me?’\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The communists really came, and they slaughtered some of the livestock the landlord hadn’t managed to take.

Rumors had it the communists would eat people’s brains—they were just waiting for the pot to boil before chopping him up for a meal, weren’t they? Ha, after living like an ox or horse all his life, who would’ve thought he’d die so disgracefully, haha… Li Jin closed his eyes, awaiting his fate.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘Old man, wake up.’ A young boy shook him awake. What? He wasn’t dead? Why hadn’t the communists killed him?!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu A bowl of soup was handed to him, ‘Old man, it’s cold, have some hot soup to warm up.’ He recognized the smell—mutton soup!

 XBJ.5.d:0 "£gezifu £gezifu With the dramatic collapse of the Qing Dynasty, China entered the turbulent era of warlords. In this half-century-long chaos, countless individuals emerged who held military power and governed their respective regions. Most of them were pure pragmatists—rather than focusing on slogans like national liberation or the Three Principles of the People, they were more concerned with how to hold onto their territory (which was usually their homeland). However, among the ranks of warlords, there were also those who genuinely had the nation at heart. Twenty years ago, during a time of national crisis, these individuals led their fellow countrymen into the grand nationwide resistance against foreign invaders... After that, these patriotic warlords chose to act as soldiers defending their homeland, and together with the United Front, they faded into history.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Perhaps the warlords who have survived to this day are those who bowed to the invaders and sold their souls to escape disaster. Even if their fathers had once raised the flag of resistance against Japan, their children still undermine each other, as if their rivals were more evil than the invaders—\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'When will the supplies arrive?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Xining reports that the guns and ammunition are ready, and about eighty percent of the food supplies are prepared, but there aren’t enough manpower and carts, so it will take another month...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'A month?' Ma Dunying wanted to vent his frustration on the messenger, but seeing his pale and thin appearance, he held back his anger and kindly instructed, 'Tell Ma Jiyuan that, on the day before Lanzhou, the soldiers of the Northwest united against the enemy. Although we were ultimately defeated and forced to retreat, we escaped with our lives and still carry the mission of our fathers to resist Japan and save the nation. A few months ago, on the walls of Xining, the soldiers of Ningxia and Qinghai fought side by side, ultimately defeating the enemy and securing a great victory. But now, the enemy still occupies Ningxia, wantonly slaughtering our friends and relatives. The soldiers of Ningxia still have the strength to defend the land against the enemy, and the determination to liberate their homeland, but their station is sparsely populated, food is insufficient, and ammunition is severely lacking. Our fathers shared deep bonds, and the fate of the Northwestern provinces is inherently tied together. Both emotionally and logically, the Ningxia and Qinghai armies should unite against the foreign invaders.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Despite speaking from the heart, an ominous thought lingered in Ma Dunying’s mind.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After sending off the messenger, Ma Dunying called for his adjutant.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Give the order: if the supplies still cannot arrive on time, we will proceed with the original plan... a military coup.'"

Over twenty years ago, when the revolution hit a low point, the weary Red Army moved from place to place and finally arrived in this land. But before they could settle down, the surviving revolutionaries had a falling out, and the Western Expeditionary Army, composed mainly of the Fourth Front Army, crossed the Yellow River, advancing into the Northwest with great momentum, only to be met with a fierce counterattack by the Ma family’s forces. Later, during the great retreat, the Communist cadres did not get a chance to pay their respects to the fallen martyrs but instead marched westward, crossing numerous blockades to reach the relatively stable Xinjiang.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Now, the red flag finally flew atop the walls of Xining, as the weathered Liu Shaoqi climbed the ancient city walls.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu At this moment, the city gates were surrounded by a dense crowd of civilians—farmers, tenant farmers, small merchants, and artisans. These people—the oppressed who struggled between the fires of war and harsh governance—had surrounded the Northwest Bureau’s work team, a red flag, and the Red Army soldiers responsible for maintaining order. There was no emotion on their faces, as if nothing in reality could stir them. Their gazes swept over the armed soldiers, the newly raised flag, and finally, all eyes fell on Liu Shaoqi.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Liu Shaoqi knew that the people here, who had endured so much suffering, were not as numb as they appeared on the outside. They were using their seemingly dull eyes to scrutinize the Red Army and the new regime. How could they convince these people, who had been tormented by brutal conscription and sweeps, that there was an armed force entirely dedicated to serving them? How could they make these people, who had been exploited by landlords and scorned by officials, believe that the new regime would truly bring about a fundamental change?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The eyes of the old Communist, who had weathered many storms, also gazed at these Xining people, who were as dark and solid as the earth itself.

He did not despise the poor for their poverty; he did not fear kings for their power; he called everyone equally to the path of Allah. The Prophet was the least inclined to anger, the most inclined to joy, the most considerate of others, the most kind to others, and the most concerned with the welfare of all.’ A simply dressed Imam slowly walked into the mosque, surrounded by the crowd.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘Imam Wali, does that mean the previous Imams were lying?’ asked a pastoral worshipper beside Wali.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu ‘The Imams here have falsely used the name of Allah to monopolize wealth, leaving the followers in poverty. The Prophet once said, “The poor among my followers will enter Paradise five hundred years before the rich.” He sat with the poor and ate with the impoverished, yet the leaders here use their position to amass wealth for themselves. They are hypocrites. The Holy Quran also states: each person enjoys only the fruits of his labor. The leaders here exploit your wealth to satisfy their own desires. This is not respecting Allah, not revering the Prophet; they are enemies of Allah,’ Wali said, pointing at the Imam inside the mosque. The group of ragged worshippers beside him now felt as if they were bathed in the warmth of spring.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu It was the most beautiful sermon they had heard in many years."

Afterward, under the command of the border region, which was extremely short of personnel, he took off his uniform and went to the grassroots to oversee the recovery of a village and land reform efforts.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Now, wearing his uniform again, he found himself in Qinghai, once more engaged in production recovery work.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Walking through the village, he noticed that unlike the distrustful villagers in Xinjiang, the people of Qinghai showed more numbness and fear in their eyes; fear that they were just the next generation of overlords, fear of the war and disaster they might bring, fear of continued enslavement... But most of all, there was numbness, the kind that comes from countless hopes turned to despair. However, Zhang Siyuan knew that just like in Xinjiang, he, they, the Red Army, would bring them hope.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He walked into the meeting hall, where people were noisily drawing lots to divide livestock.

The situation in Qinghai was different from that in Xinjiang. When facing the Japanese, various interest groups in Qinghai temporarily set aside their differences to fight the enemy together—just like the United Front of the past. In the face of the Japanese army’s massacre, society as a whole was outraged, and landlords voluntarily ceded some power to the peasants. Representatives of all classes formed this 'People’s Government,' and the complexity of its class composition was evident just from looking at the roster.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As his eyes scanned the names on the roster, Liu Shaoqi couldn’t help but feel a headache coming on. Although Communist Party members still made up the relative majority and barely held administrative power, the rest of the government was full of future hidden dangers. First, there were Ma Dunying and his old subordinates. As he flipped further, the names of enlightened gentry, bourgeoisie, and even enlightened landlords came into view. Although under the banner of resisting Japan, they generally still supported the government’s policies, but apart from 'resisting Japan,' these people were unlikely to reach any other consensus. But what other choice was there? If we didn’t do this, how could we face the Northwest Army sharpening their knives in Lanzhou? How could we resist the Japanese army’s future reinforcements? With the enemy at the gate, we have no choice but to unite all forces that can be united...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Closing the roster, he knew that the so-called Qinghai 'People’s Government' was far from being a government that truly served the people.

First, unite the people on this roster, then ease the growing conflicts, and use the remaining time to prepare the military... "

Unsure if the enemy was still in pursuit, the soldiers dared not stop to rest, nor could they turn back to bury the bodies of their fallen comrades. They had once been the proud National Revolutionary Army, but now they were nothing more than a band of ragged, fleeing bandits, wearing tattered uniforms and wielding broken guns.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Jiang Jingguo had no idea when such days would end.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Since his father’s death, the United Front had fallen apart. His memories of those dark days were already blurred. All he knew was that the army had scattered, the entire country was in chaos... China was finished. Dragged along by a defeated army, he had arrived in the vast Northwest—one of the few places not yet touched by war.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After learning of his father’s death, he was filled with grief and anger, eager to raise the banner of resistance once more—in Lanzhou, he was received by Ma Bufang. But apart from this cold reception, the Ma family, which dominated the Northwest, was unwilling to offer anything more. They 'invited' Jiang Jingguo to stay in Lanzhou, supposedly to 'avoid the eyes of the Japanese,' but in reality, they had placed him under house arrest.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu And so time continued to pass. The Ma family still monopolized Northwest trade, the only difference being that the profits were now in yen. Vast wealth flowed into Ma Bufang’s pockets, and Lanzhou remained a city of endless revelry.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu For Jiang Jingguo, it was a dreamlike time. The fragrance of fine wine intoxicated him, the elegance of the socialites captivated him, and the clinking of glasses held him spellbound. He began to feel as if he had returned to the vibrant Bund of Shanghai, or the misty shores of West Lake in Hangzhou. Under the banner of the invader, the Chinese people were enjoying the treasure they had long yearned for—peace.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But when Jiang Jingguo, still tipsy, stepped into the cold night of late autumn, he saw a different scene—on the streets of Lanzhou, several old soldiers lay sprawled across the road. They were so starved that their faces were gaunt, and their uniforms were stained with the filthiest of human secretions. Yet passersby merely lowered their heads and skirted around them as if avoiding a plague...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The sight, accompanied by the howling wind of late autumn, jolted Jiang Jingguo into a sudden sobriety—he should have seen through the bloody reality hidden beneath the guise of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere'; he should have stood up and carried on his father’s legacy; he should have fought side by side with these soldiers, dying together on the path of sacrificing for the motherland...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Shaking off the stench of alcohol, he walked with a steady and determined stride."

 XBJ.14.d:0 "£gezifu £gezifu Ma Dunying could never have imagined that when the Ningxia army raised the flag of rebellion in despair, it would miraculously receive a response from displaced people all over Qinghai. Just as the Hui people once forced Ma Bufang onto the anti-Japanese war chariot, Ma Dunying now became the hope of the Han people who had migrated to Qinghai due to the turmoil and were being marginalized by the locals.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu News spread faster than the Ningxia army’s advance. In every village the uprising army reached, the oppressed refugees gathered in response, offering urgently needed supplies or directly joining the rebel ranks. Even in places beyond the reach of the uprising, many refugee communities raised the Ningxia army’s banner. In no time, Ma Dunying’s forces were spread throughout Qinghai.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The harsh exploitation by Ma Bufang, the oppression by religious officials, the unreasonable conscription system... All these accumulated conflicts erupted in full force. Everywhere, militia men were eager to settle old scores and exact brutal revenge on their enemies. Lacking the courage, authority, and even basic intelligence needed to quell the rebellion, Ma Jiyuan’s forces were left to suppress it everywhere—undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The situation had spiraled out of control. Ma Dunying initially hoped to use this uprising to unite the increasingly divided Ningma and Qingma factions against a common enemy. But before the Japanese could invade, the Northwest stronghold had already collapsed from within. When Ma Dunying came to his senses, he realized that he had already become a national traitor.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Every day, he anxiously paced around his headquarters, desperately thinking of ways to atone for his mistakes.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Ma Dunying did not dare to waste a single moment—for while the people of Qinghai bled in factional strife, the enemy was tirelessly preparing for war. Every hour, a truckload of military supplies arrived in Lanzhou; every day, another batch of fanatical militarists reached the front lines...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'General, we’ve received a telegram... It’s from Xinjiang.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Hasn’t Sheng Shicai been cozying up to the Japanese for a while now? What good could he possibly offer us?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'It seems... it’s not Sheng Shicai,' the communications officer stammered, seemingly unable to believe the contents of the telegram himself. 'The sender claims to be from the “Soviet Government of Xinjiang” and wishes to discuss aid with you.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Only then did Ma Dunying suddenly recall—there seemed to be some unknown force aiding the people in the western part of Qinghai. It appeared that the other party had both the ability and the willingness to provide assistance. However, dealing with the Communists was also extremely dangerous.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu If it were his father, as long as it could stop the enemy’s advance and protect the people, he would undoubtedly agree without hesitation, even if the price was giving up all privileges.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu With that in mind, Ma Dunying called the telegraph operator—"

Ma Dun Jing sighed involuntarily, thinking of the recent turmoil in the Northwest, 'Mr. Liu, you may not know, but the current chaos in the Northwest is all due to the Japanese invaders. With Lanzhou fallen, we’ve had no choice but to seek refuge here... In such times of national crisis, the people of the Northwest should unite against the enemy, but now every household is closed off, every village fortified...

I know you have doubts about whether the Communist Party still holds a grudge over the blood debt from thirty years ago.

The son took on his father’s dying wish, pushing himself forward day after day. He began to issue orders like his father, tirelessly moving through Qinghai, mediating the hatred that spread across the land. He exhausted the Ma family’s wealth of decades, rebuilt the Qinghai Army, and dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese invaders in the Battle of Xining... Everything had been on the right track, but how had it come to this?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Temporarily stopping his thoughts, Ma Ji Yuan quietly entered the dark inner room.

XBJ.17.t:0 "Land Reform Report in Qinghai"
XBJ.17.d:0 "£gezifu £gezifu The land reform and pastoral area reforms in Qinghai have achieved remarkable results. There are certainly objective factors at play, such as the threat of Japanese invasion, which led the landlord class to make some concessions and compromises—much like how the Party’s 'rent reduction and interest reduction' policy in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region did not face significant resistance.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu However, without a doubt, the successful completion of an almost bloodless land reform under such difficult circumstances is ultimately due to the experience our Party gained during the land reform in Xinjiang. I believe that summarizing these experiences in writing will benefit the Party's long-term work in the Northwest:\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 1. Pay attention to the unique class environment in the Northwest, particularly the close ties between the landlord class and religious forces. In Xinjiang, this is manifested in the collusion between landlords and religious forces. In Qinghai, there are 'theocratic' Menhuan, who hold secular power and act as large landlords, ruling with an iron fist. Not only peasants but even some secular landlords are dissatisfied with their rule, but they dare not speak out due to their control over religious authority. By introducing the old Islamic teachings from Xinjiang, our working groups managed to dispel the sanctity of hereditary Menhuan in the minds of some, making it possible to unite peasants, small landlords, and rich peasants in the struggle against the Menhuan class.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 2. Emphasize the building of workers' and peasants' armed forces. In Xinjiang, the Red Guards organized by the peasants were the backbone of defending the gains of the land reform due to the intensity of the class struggle. In Qinghai, the situation is more complex; due to years of war, fallow land often accounts for half of a region's cultivated land. Therefore, the focus of each land reform working group has been on resettling refugees and restoring production. If land is insufficient, the Menhuan class’s land is redistributed. As a result, except for resistance from some landlords, the land reform in Qinghai did not provoke widespread opposition. However, in resisting bandits and possibly repelling future Japanese invasions, a strong peasant Red Guard is still the most important guarantee of the revolution.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 3. Focus on building propaganda institutions and the Party, particularly paying attention to ethnic issues. Whether in Xinjiang or Qinghai, the Party organizations have developed from scratch. The Party’s size has expanded, and new members include both Han and minority groups. Many people have heard of the Communist Party and socialism for the first time, but their lifestyle and conduct are far from the standards expected of a Communist Party member. However, ignoring ethnic differences and imposing uniform standards is also inappropriate. This requires us to reform the cultures of various ethnic groups and promote a revolutionary new culture.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu These are the specific matters regarding land reform in Qinghai. As for the collectivization of the pastoral areas, it was more convenient to follow the model of Xinjiang. The reason is that before this, the 'tea-horse trade' monopolized by the Ma family had concentrated the production materials of the pastoral areas. After nationalizing the Huangzhong Industries, we controlled the economic lifeline of the pastoral areas, making it easier to promote collectivization."

As long as he brought tobacco, they wouldn’t question his identity as a clean-cut officer, but would instead sit down, sharing their stories while inhaling the acrid smell of smoke.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Every story began with the great retreat of 1945. Separated from their commanders, soldiers fled the Japanese, beginning a long journey of escape. Initially, everyone hoped to return home, but in the chaos of wartime China, this was a monumental task! Along the way, they exhausted their ammunition, gained new wounds, and many were left disabled.

The lucky ones found work as tenant farmers, while the less fortunate dragged their weary bodies from one odd job to another. When endless labor finally broke their bodies, they would grab a broken bowl, head to the gates of Lanzhou, and hope the lords would remember their past service in defending the country and give them a meal.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu At this point, the veterans would often grab their pipes and take a deep drag.

The remaining space held a large table surrounded by several officers (the Red Army seemed not to equip their officers with distinctive attire), who were discussing post-battle plans over a spread-out map and documents.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu When Chiang Ching-kuo entered, an elderly man looked up slowly.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'If you’re here to register... please wait a moment, we’re in a meeting...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I’m the commander of the Northwest New First Division, here to see the Red Army’s commander.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Liu Shaoqi had certainly heard of this elite unit—when the Northwest War broke out, Ma Bufang had formed the 'Northwest New Army' with veterans and reserves from various regions. The 'New First Division,' composed of veterans from the Anti-Japanese War, was the true elite. In the brutal Northwest conflicts, they had operated on the frontlines and in the rear, disrupting Japanese supply lines and demonstrating remarkable combat effectiveness.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The commander of this legendary unit was much younger than Liu Shaoqi had expected.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'So you are Ching-kuo... I’ve heard much about you.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Likewise... Mr. Liu, you are truly a legend, repeatedly defeating the enemy’s advances in Northern Shaanxi, standing firm under heavy siege, and now rescuing millions in the Northwest from disaster...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'My young friend, I truly don’t deserve such praise! After being oppressed by imperialism for so many years, no Chinese person doesn’t want to stand up with pride. Rather than saying one or two heroes changed history, it’s more accurate to say that millions of people raised their fists together, driving the wolves out of the Northwest...'"

The victory won by the people today will be forever etched in the annals of revolutionary history.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu At this moment of celebration, we have more good news to convey to you—the reorganized intelligence department has established contact with the Central Committee in the Southwest. Through years of struggle, they have established a vast revolutionary base on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Moreover, they have formed a new united front against Japan with General Long Yun’s National Protection Army. Our comrades in the Southwest are currently engaged in fierce battles with the puppet government supported by Japanese imperialism. It won’t be long before the call for national resistance will once again resound across the land!\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The Central Committee has ordered us to launch an offensive from the Northwest to support the National Protection Army’s advance.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Taking advantage of the severe blow dealt to the Japanese forces, you might consider launching a major offensive to retake Lanzhou in one fell swoop.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As for the timing and scale of the operation, please decide at your discretion.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The Xinjiang Bureau of the Communist Party of China."

Rough estimates put the total casualties, including militia, Northwest Ma Family Army, and Red Army, at several hundred, with detailed casualty and enemy kill counts still being compiled.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Although it wasn’t a severe defeat, the harsh reality has dampened the revolutionary fervor. As the overall head of the Northwest Bureau, I must bear primary responsibility for this failure. Here is my summary of the reasons for this defeat:\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 1. Military infrastructure remains unsteady, and the coordination between units was poor—this is the main reason for the failure. The composition of the forces participating in the Lanzhou campaign was extremely complex, including loyal revolutionary Xinjiang militia, the militia forces from the new Xining base area, the Northwest Army loyal to Ma Dun Jing, and guerrilla forces around Lanzhou. With my command unfamiliar with the terrain, the coordination between these units was significantly disrupted. Although the Ma Family Army temporarily captured Lanzhou, the militia was delayed by mountain roads and failed to provide timely support. We must reflect deeply on this and establish a complete command and coordination system.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 2. The enemy’s strength far exceeded expectations, and our preparation was insufficient—this is an objective reason for the failure. In any struggle, apart from the subjective revolutionary will, it is also crucial to consider whether external conditions are sufficient to achieve revolutionary goals. Before the battle, based on the enemy’s long-term confrontation with guerrilla forces and the overall favorable revolutionary situation nationwide, our assessment of the Japanese army’s combat capability was: 'severe equipment attrition, low morale, and heavy weapons like tanks unsuitable for the mountainous terrain of the Northwest.' This led us to underestimate the difficulties we would face in battle and to fail to devise effective countermeasures, resulting in severe failure. In the future, we must find ways to counter the enemy’s fortification and artillery tactics.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 3. The spread of extreme revolutionary optimism—essentially a form of opportunism—this is the fundamental reason for the failure. After years of underground activity, the revolution finally made encouraging progress. However, some newly joined comrades, unaware of the harshness of the struggle and the brutality of Japanese imperialism, believed that slogans and posturing alone could lead to victory. The spread of this opportunism led to the reckless exposure of our forces, even as the Northwest government remained unstable, the national revolutionary situation remained unclear, and Japanese imperialism still held the upper hand. I believe that if we do not purge this trend within the Party, the Party will suffer even greater losses.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Appendix: Although we did not achieve our stated goals, our offensive still inflicted short-term, significant damage on the Japanese forces. According to the latest intelligence from the front, the Japanese army has already withdrawn from border positions and isolated village outposts, pulling back their defensive line to the vicinity of Lanzhou city and the supply lines around the Yellow River. The number of enemy sweeps has significantly decreased. We have already dispatched experienced cadres to contact various guerrilla forces."
