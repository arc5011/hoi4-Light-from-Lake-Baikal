Mao_Anying: "Mao Anying"
COX_Mao_Anying_desc: "Mao Anying was not only the eldest son of China's revolutionary leader but also a child of the revolution. From birth, he was on the move with his parents for the revolutionary cause. At the age of 8, his mother was arrested and soon after, she sacrificed her life. He and his brothers were taken to Shanghai by the underground party. However, the underground party in Shanghai was soon destroyed, leaving them to fend for themselves on the streets. During this time, he worked odd jobs, collected waste, delivered newspapers, and pulled rickshaws. Despite the harsh environment, his revolutionary passion was never extinguished but became even stronger under the brutalities of the old society.\n\nIn 1936, he went to the Soviet Union to study. A year later, the Japanese invaded China in large numbers, sparking the War of Resistance against Japan. What he didn't know was that soon he would be the only child left for the revolution. After the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, he voluntarily entered the military academy to fight against the fascist invaders. However, the war took a turn no one expected, and the Soviet Union was defeated, cutting off all communications with China. The changing situation in China was unclear from newspapers, but more and more retreating Chinese troops entering the Far East brought increasingly accurate news - his father had failed. Finally, an old Communist party member brought him a letter, the hastily written words seemed to be from his father - "Wanderer, do not yearn to return."\n\nHeeding his father's words, Mao Anying never returned to his homeland. After graduating from the military academy, he served on the Western Russian revolutionary front. After experiencing the bitter defeat of the Western Russian war and unpleasant political struggles, he finally decided to leave and head east. At the key point of his journey - beside Lake Baikal - a legion of Chinese gathered around him. Some had served the Soviets since the October Revolution, some were from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, and some were the old Red Army workers and peasants who had barely evacuated the occupied areas.\n\nAs time passed, the green mountains and clear waters of Shaoshan, the narrow lanes of the Bund in Shanghai, the fertile fields of the Northeast, and the highlands of the Loess Plateau became blurred memories from clear recollections. The scenery of the hometown became vague, but the feeling of homesickness grew stronger. The Siberian monsoon blew southward every year, and the wanderer who had been away for a long time increasingly missed his hometown. The landscape of his hometown had been occupied by invaders, and the people were being treated like slaves. As the only child of the Chinese revolution, he could no longer stand idly by."

  COX_cpc_center_desc: "Revolution never has a smooth journey - everyone sitting here understands this very well.\n\nThe vigorous land reform ultimately failed to win the support of the people in Xinjiang. The landlords and imams who had entrenched in Xinjiang for many years seized this great opportunity. With oppression returning, the militia scattered like birds, cadres were slaughtered, and the entire border region government was in chaos - except for the soldiers of the 88th Guard Brigade. The feudal forces ultimately failed to bring their brutality over the Tianshan Mountains, but the border area also failed to bring their liberation to the entire Xinjiang.\n\nNow, the only remaining members of the border area sit here, silently agreeing to Mao Anying's resignation request. This son of the revolution ultimately could not manage everything with the same confidence as his father. Has the hope that supported them in Siberia for so many years gone out?\n\nOf course not - everyone sitting here firmly believes. One day, the light from Lake Baikal will illuminate Xinjiang again, the sparks left by that scholar will eventually set the prairie on fire, and the shouts in the dreams of countless Chinese people will eventually come true...\n\n§RBut how much longer will that be?\nNo one knows this.§!"

Joining the party in 1921, he is one of the oldest members in terms of tenure. He is also one of the few confirmed survivors of the central cadres after the Chongqing defeat. Contrary to many people's imagination, Liu Shaoqi does not feel guilty about his decision to evacuate Chongqing. Even if he fought to the death, what could change? The dead are indeed great, but they are also forever at ease, and the unfinished work must always be undertaken by the living. He - Liu Shaoqi - is the one to bear this burden.\n\nFor the ultimate liberation of China, Liu Shaoqi worked tirelessly. In his heart, traditional Bukharinism does not fit China's national conditions, but he has a path of adapting Bukharinism to China's national conditions. Although he has never mentioned this path to anyone, Liu Shaoqi firmly believes that Xinjiang is not his dream's endpoint. One day, he will return to Yan'an and spread the seeds of socialism across China. This is his remaining life's dream, and if it shatters, he is willing to die for it.§!"

Unlike most CCP cadres, Zhang Wentian is more skilled in theory and propaganda than grassroots work, which often puts him in an awkward position within the Xinjiang branch. With almost no domestic or foreign contacts and the branch isolated in Xinjiang, what diplomatic work can be done, and who to propagandize to? Most of the time, Zhang Wentian acts as the branch's pen, writing some dispensable documents. Due to his lack of understanding of grassroots struggles, he can't raise any objections and can only waste time idly. Zhang Wentian naturally dislikes the puppet's identity but finds it hard to change. Although the young people returning from Russia somewhat reignited his long-forgotten passion, he still believes that his diplomatic talents can never be fully utilized if the Xinjiang branch remains in the dark.§!"

He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1926 and has since been dedicated to the propaganda of socialism and the establishment of base areas in the northwest. He never lacked the courage to dedicate himself to the revolution, but the internal anti-spying campaign that took place in the Shaan-Gan base area in 1935 changed him forever. Gao Gang, who once bravely charged into the gunfire, became silent and merely sorted out the economy. In his heart, the shadows of torture and interrogation never truly disappeared.\n\nHowever, being silent does not mean indifference. Gao Gang always held doubts about the socialist construction policies proposed by Liu Shaoqi. Not only did he question its feasibility, but he also wondered how the "limited" market would be ensured. Over time, Gao Gang found that these doubts spread among the returning soldiers faster than he imagined. Young soldiers would not remain silent like him. This worry made Gao Gang extremely tired. He often thought that perhaps retirement might be the best choice for him.§!"

Holding this belief, Chen Geng patiently safeguarded the Xinjiang branch while waiting for the right opportunity. However, time spares no one, and the rigors of work and past gunshot wounds increasingly tormented Chen Geng's health. Constant threats of myocardial infarction loomed.

  #Liu_Shaoqi
XBJ_Liu_Shaoqi_desc: "Seeking opportunities for the revolution at its lowest point, finding hope for the entire nation in the most desperate times, this is the "party spirit" of Liu Shaoqi that has persisted to this day. He dedicated his youth to the great revolution, shed his blood on the battlefield against the Japanese invasion, and in his later years, exhausted everything for the survival of the party. When the defeat was inevitable, the party had to abandon its base in Yan'an and set out on a new Long March to the southwest. Liu Shaoqi voluntarily stayed in Yan'an to maintain the fragmented underground party organization.

The struggle in northern Shaanxi became more and more difficult every day, with the pressure from the Japanese army increasing daily. The party was increasingly unable to move freely in northern Shaanxi... In the most dangerous years, the party was surrounded and divided on both sides of the Yellow River. To preserve its vitality, Liu Shaoqi had to lead the remnants of the party to retreat to the northwest...

The westward journey of the Communist Party went smoothly, and after successfully passing through the warlord-controlled areas of Shanxi and Qinghai, Liu Shaoqi was fortunate to find the party organization in Xinjiang. Although the Shengshi Caizheng government was willing to provide a place for the Communist Party, Liu Shaoqi was well aware of the warlords' wavering stance, so when the inevitable betrayal came, the Communist Party was fully prepared and minimized its losses.

Liu Shaoqi went through the darkest times of the party, saving it with all his might, leaving an indelible mark on his character. Compared to actively mobilizing the masses, he believes more in meticulous planning and the use of intelligence. Even though he adopts a more pragmatic stance, no one can doubt his loyalty to the revolution."

Ma_Dunjing: "Ma Dunjing"
XBJ_Ma_Dunjing_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government§!\n§YWarlord§!\n------------\n§Swinging from side to side, always indecisive—this seems to be the survival philosophy shared by all warlords who have managed to carve out a territory in these chaotic times. Thanks to this, to some extent, the warlords have established various somewhat stable regimes.

Half a century has quietly passed, and the chaos in China remains. Therefore, just like other regimes around the world, they need qualified successors. Warlords often place their chosen direct descendants or promising young people in their families into the army early on, giving them positions such as "aide-de-camp" or "brigade commander", teaching them the way of the warlord.

Ma Dunjing is one of the best among these young people.

From a young age, he was well-versed in literature and knew Arabic, interpreting scriptures according to the wishes of adults. In his father Ma Hongbin's army, he rose rapidly, from the rank of camp to regiment, brigade, and division... Before the age of 30, he became the chief of staff of the 81st Army. In the eyes of others, he was just promoted because of his father's authority—even though Ma Dunjing often argued with others, his father did not avoid this fact. The conflicts in the northwest were not as fierce as those in the Central Plains. In his father's plan, his sons would accumulate merits and experience in anti-banditry and small-scale conflicts. When the time comes, he can honorably retire and hand over the defense to his trustworthy sons...

However, things did not go as planned. The full-scale invasion of China by the Japanese Empire shattered the sad regionalist illusions of countless warlords. Numerous young people were inspired by the passion of resisting Japan, while astute warlords smelled the signs of drastic change from the establishment of the united front. Although they had different thoughts, Ma Dunjing and his father, Ma Hongbin, both stepped onto the battlefield against Japan.

In the brutal war in Sui and Xi, Ma Dunjing witnessed countless atrocities by the enemy and was deeply touched by the sacrifices of the people of Jin and Sui. The flames of war made him quickly grow into an experienced general, a leader who sang patriotic songs, but he increasingly deviated from the path of a qualified warlord. His heart was already filled with the spirit of the whole nation's common hatred of the enemy. The Chinese nation should live and die together, and "seeking to protect oneself by remaining neutral" was never a realistic option.

He couldn't have imagined at that time that even with the combined efforts of the entire nation, it wasn't guaranteed to win the war. What he couldn't even think of was that one day, the flames of war would burn to his hometown. Nowadays, the people of the northwest suffer from atrocities that are even worse than those in Sui and Xi at the time. For his beloved hometown, Ma Dunjing is willing to give everything to drive out the Japanese invaders as soon as possible. L§!"

He stands firmly in the northwest and contributes to his country. He is a model figure in the northwest and the best proof of the modernization of the northwest region. Thanks to the years of studying in Turkey and the Middle East, Ma Dunjing is a person with a unique vision. He knows that in the chaos of the current times, a stable northwest is beneficial to China as a whole. He insists on maintaining a stable and good relationship with the Qing Dynasty, establishing a free trade zone, improving infrastructure, and emphasizing modern education. Under his leadership, the northwest is no longer an inaccessible place, but a bridge connecting China and the outside world. L§!"

XBJ_Bo_Yibo_sec_desc: "§YSecurity Minister§!\n§YBukharinism§!\n------------\n§LBo Yibo was born on February 6, 1908, in Jiang Village, Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province. Like many of his peers, his youth coincided with the climax of the Great Revolution, where he saw the future of the nation and actively joined in. 1925 marked his complete break from the old society—supporting the anti-tax movement of the people in Taiyuan and responding to the May 30th patriotic movement. As a pioneering progressive youth of Shanxi, he joined the Communist Youth League in the autumn of that year and became a member of the Communist Party of China in December. However, the Great Revolution, which should have brought a bright future for the entire nation, was eventually destroyed by the reactionary faction of the Kuomintang. Throughout the 1930s, he was imprisoned three times, once sentenced to death, and was not rescued by the party until 1936. After being rescued, Bo Yibo was sent to Shanxi to oversee the Party's work in the province. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he took on the task of forming a new army, the "Shanxi Youth Anti-Japanese Death Squad". His extensive experience working in the Kuomintang-controlled areas made him familiar with their treacherous nature. When Yan Xishan attacked the new army during the anti-communist climax of 1939, a well-prepared Bo Yibo quickly thwarted his scheme. After the defeat in the Anti-Japanese War, the Shanxi Anti-Japanese Death Squad was in the dangerous border region between Shaanxi and Shanxi. When they finally retreated to the less enemy-controlled area of northern Shaanxi, the central government had already moved to the southwest. The profound mass base in northern Shaanxi prompted Bo Yibo to decide to rebuild the revolutionary base there. The guerrilla warfare of the Anti-Japanese Death Squad continued into the 1950s when the Republic of China government was determined to suppress the rebellion in Shaanxi. The Red Army, lacking weapons and personnel replenishments, could not compete with the "government army" equipped with Japanese machinery. Some continued to fight in smaller units in northern Shaanxi, while others chose to retreat to the northwest, crossing the Qilian Mountains, passing through the desert, and arriving in Xinjiang. Despite his age, Bo Yibo remained spirited and vigorous. Time did not diminish his fighting spirit against the enemy, but rather honed his guerrilla tactics to perfection.§!"

XBJ_Li_Xiannian_for_desc: "§YForeign Minister§!\n§YMao Zedong Thought§!\n------------\n§LLi Xiannian was born in 1909 in Huang'an County, Hubei Province. In November 1936, on the orders of the Party Central Committee, he, as a member of the Military and Political Committee of the Western Route Army, led a unit to invade Ma's territory, trying to establish a base in Hexi, to open a route to Xinjiang and establish contact with the Communist International. The western expedition was not smooth. The unfamiliar terrain caused the Red Army to face fierce counterattacks from Ma's army, with risks of being wiped out. However, under the brave fight of the soldiers and Li Xiannian's flexible command, the 30th Army first forced its way through the Yellow River and then fought fiercely with the enemy between Liangzhou and Yongchang, annihilating more than 4,000 enemy troops. Although the western expedition did not establish a base in Hexi as expected, it did open the way to Xinjiang. In 1937, Li Xiannian led the remnants of the western expeditionary army across the Qilian Mountain watershed, marching through the snow-capped mountains for over 20 days and then crossing the desolate Gobi Desert to reach the Xingxing Gorge at the junction of Gansu and Xinjiang in late April. This group became the backbone of the Communist Party's Xinjiang branch. In 1938, with the intensification of the Anti-Japanese War, Li Xiannian returned to northern Shaanxi. When the Japanese army invaded Chongqing, he did not follow the central government to the southwest but led a brigade to continue guerrilla warfare in the occupied Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region. In the early 1950s, with the government's campaign to suppress the resistance in northern Shaanxi, Li Xiannian had to lead his troops to Xinjiang again. If the previous journey was a long march, this time it was truly a massive retreat. Fortunately, in the northwest corner of the country, there were people ready to welcome this old revolutionary who had traveled more than half of China. In the decades after the war, as the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps took shape, he turned his hand to agriculture and made great contributions to the development of the western region.§!"
