Mao_Anying: "Mao Anying"
COX_Mao_Anying_desc: "Mao Anying is not only the eldest son of China's revolutionary leader but also a child of the revolution. Since birth, he has traveled around for the revolutionary cause with his parents. At the age of 8, his mother was imprisoned and soon sacrificed her life. He and his brother were taken by the underground party to live in Shanghai. However, the underground party organization in Shanghai was soon destroyed, leaving them homeless. During this period, he did odd jobs, collected scraps, delivered newspapers, and pushed rickshaws. Although the environment was harsh, his passion for revolution was never extinguished; instead, it grew stronger, tempered by the cruelty of the old society.\n\nIn 1936, he went to study in the Soviet Union. A year later, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China, sparking the War of Resistance against Japan. What he didn't know was that soon he would become the only child of the revolution. After the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, he volunteered to join the military academy to fight against the fascist invaders. However, the war took an unexpected turn, and the Soviet Union was defeated, cutting off communication with his homeland. The news about China's situation was unpredictable, and more and more Chinese retreating into the Far East brought increasingly accurate information—his father had failed. Eventually, an old Communist brought him a letter, with rough handwriting that seemed to be from his father—'Do not long for home, my child.'\n\nRemembering his father's teachings, Mao Anying never returned to his homeland. After graduating from the military academy, he served on the Western Russian Revolutionary Front. After experiencing the bitter defeat of the West Russian War and unpleasant political struggles, he finally decided to leave and head east. At a key point in the journey—by Lake Baikal—a Chinese legion gradually gathered around him. Some had been serving the Soviets since the October Revolution, some were remnants of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, and others were veteran soldiers of the Red Army who had barely escaped the occupied areas.\n\nAs time passed, the green hills and waters of Shaoshan, the narrow alleys of the Bund in Shanghai, the fertile fields of the Northeast, and the loess plateau turned from clear memories into blurred images. The homeland became hazy, but the longing for it remained. The Siberian monsoon blows southward every year, and the wanderers who have been away from home for a long time miss it even more. But the mountains and rivers of his homeland were occupied by invaders, and his people were being treated like livestock. As the only child of the Chinese revolution, he could no longer stand by and do nothing."

The landlords and imams who had been entrenched in Xinjiang for years seized this great opportunity to return with oppression. The militias scattered, the cadres were slaughtered, and the entire border government was in chaos—except for the soldiers of the 88th Guards Brigade. The feudal forces ultimately could not bring their brutality across the Tianshan Mountains, but the border region could not bring liberation to all of Xinjiang.\n\nNow, the remaining committee members of the border region sit here silently, agreeing to Mao Anying's resignation. This child of the revolution has not yet managed to govern everything with confidence like his father did. Has the hope that sustained them during their years of wandering in Siberia been extinguished?\n\nOf course not—everyone sitting here firmly believes that one day, the light from Lake Baikal will once again illuminate Xinjiang, the spark left by that scholar will eventually ignite a prairie fire, and the dreams of countless Chinese people will finally come true...\n\n§RBut how long will that take?\nNo one knows this."

Unlike most CCP cadres, Zhang Wentian is better at theory and propaganda than grassroots work, which often places him in an awkward position within the Xinjiang branch. With domestic and foreign communications virtually cut off and the branch isolated in Xinjiang, what diplomatic work can be done, and to whom should propaganda be directed? In most cases, Zhang Wentian serves as the branch's scribe, writing some trivial documents. Due to his lack of understanding of grassroots struggles, he cannot offer any objections and can only waste time idly. Naturally, Zhang Wentian does not enjoy his role as a puppet, but he finds it difficult to change.

He was not lacking in the courage to sacrifice for the revolution, but the internal purges that occurred in the Shaanxi-Gansu base in 1935 changed him forever. Once daring to fight shirtless amidst gunfire, Gao Gang became taciturn and quietly focused on economic work. The shadows cast by those interrogations and torture sessions never truly left him.\n\nEven so, being taciturn does not mean being indifferent. Although Gao Gang remained silent about Liu Shaoqi's proposed socialist construction plan, he always harbored doubts—not only about its feasibility but also about how 'limited' the market would guarantee it. Over time, Gao Gang found that these doubts were spreading among the returning soldiers at a speed far beyond his imagination. The young soldiers would not remain as silent as he did—such concerns left Gao Gang exhausted. He often thought that perhaps retirement was the best choice for him."

COX_Abbasof_desc: "Abdukerim Abbasov, born in 1921 in Atush, Xinjiang, was influenced by Chinese Communist Party members such as Yu Xiusong while studying in Dihua in 1935 and joined the anti-imperialist patriotic mass organization 'Xinjiang People's Anti-Imperialist Union,' thus embarking on the revolutionary path. After witnessing the collapse of the Soviet Union, the beacon of communism, he was determined to keep the flame of revolution burning. In 1942, after becoming the superintendent of education in the Ili Administrative Office under the 'Red Warlord' Sheng Shicai's rule in Xinjiang, he immediately began secretly organizing a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist group called the 'Liberation Society,' promoting Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideas. In early 1946, he finally saw an opportunity—a chance to overthrow Sheng Shicai. Zhang Zhizhong's troops, retreating from northern Chongqing to the northwestern interior, clashed with Sheng Shicai's forces east of Hami. To resist Zhang Zhizhong's offensive, Sheng Shicai mobilized most of his troops, leaving Xinjiang internally empty; at the same time, Sheng Shicai's harsh levies to fund the war caused widespread dissatisfaction among farmers and herders. Abbasov immediately united with Moslimov's Gongha guerrilla forces and launched the 'Xinjiang Liberation Movement,' advancing toward Ili. Faced with internal and external attacks, Sheng Shicai was quickly defeated. Abbasov also announced the establishment of the 'Provisional Government of Xinjiang' in Ili and extended an offer to negotiate with Zhang Zhizhong.\nBut Zhang Zhizhong did not give him that chance—he outwardly participated in the establishment meeting of the provisional government, showing an ambiguous attitude, while secretly sending people to infiltrate Xinjiang, bribing landlords and imams with large sums of money and promising them autonomy after defeating Abbasov. Soon, with the time ripe, the Xinjiang Provisional Government was defeated by internal and external attacks. Moslimov was mortally wounded in the defense of Ili, and Yu Xiusong and other old Chinese Communist Party members either died in battle or were captured and executed. The core members of the Liberation Society either perished or fled.\nFaced with great sorrow after great joy, Abbasov did not despair nor flee. After the failure of the Ili defense, he disguised himself as a landlord's servant and escaped the encirclement with dozens of people, leading the Gongha guerrillas, now leaderless, to the border of (New) Junggar and (New) Tuvan to engage in guerrilla warfare. Tsedenbal once provided him with aid and allowed him to assist the Mongolian People's Front as an auxiliary force. Vasilevsky also provided him with a little supply out of revolutionary camaraderie. In subsequent battles, although more people left the group, Abbasov did not lose heart. As the power of the local landlords and gentry in Xinjiang grew, Zhang Zhizhong's control over Xinjiang gradually weakened, giving the Gongha guerrillas a chance to survive.\nTwenty years have passed, and his faith in the revolution has never wavered, but the opportunity to return to Xinjiang seems increasingly distant. At this time, the news that a force from outside—Mao Anying's Chinese Brigade—had captured Urumqi still shocked him, and the banner they raised filled him with excitement. Now, what could stop him from leading the charge?"

As one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, Chen Tanqiu had witnessed too many historical ups and downs. He had seen the grand mobilization of tens of thousands of farmers during the National Revolution, the Nationalist Party's counter-revolutionary crackdown on revolutionary forces, and the spectacle of four hundred million people resisting Japan. In September 1939, he was ordered to return to China to serve as the representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Xinjiang.\nWhen Sheng Shicai openly began anti-communist activities, Chen Tanqiu, along with Mao Zemin, engaged in a tough struggle against him. The struggle was arduous and exhausting; Mao Zemin sacrificed his life, while Chen Tanqiu successfully led the remaining Communists into the grassroots of Xinjiang, beginning a ten-year-long underground struggle. During the long underground struggle, the sparks of the Chinese Communist Party seemed difficult to reignite.\nUntil those Russian exiles, waving a burning red flag, defeated the once invincible 'King of Xinjiang' Sheng Shicai, did Chen Tanqiu recall his fiery youth. He saw a vague hope for the Chinese revolution in Mao Anying. He hoped that one day he would witness the light of Marxism shining across China. But he knew his time was running out. The prolonged frontline struggle had almost ruined his body. Though only two years older than Liu Shaoqi, he looked twenty years older. His time was limited, but Anying had yet to mature…§!"

As a vanguard of progressive youth in Shanxi, he joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in the autumn of that year and became a member of the Chinese Communist Party in December... However, the Great Revolution, which was supposed to bring a bright future to the entire nation, was ultimately destroyed by the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang. Throughout the 1930s, he was imprisoned three times and once sentenced to death. It was not until 1936 that the Party rescued him.\nAfter his rescue, Bo Yibo was sent to Shanxi to take overall responsibility for the Party's work in the province. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he was tasked with forming a new army, the 'Shanxi Youth Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps.' His extensive experience working in White areas made him well aware of the Kuomintang reactionaries' nature. When Yan Xishan took advantage of the anti-communist upsurge in 1939 to attack the New Fourth Army, Bo Yibo, who had prepared in advance, quickly thwarted his plot.\nAfter the defeat of the War of Resistance, the Shanxi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps was in a dangerous position on the border between Shanxi and Shaanxi. When they finally retreated to the relatively weakly controlled area of northern Shaanxi, the Central Committee had already moved to the southwest. The deep popular base in northern Shaanxi prompted Bo Yibo to decide to rebuild the revolutionary base here.\nThe guerrilla war of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps continued until the early 1950s when the National Government decided to eradicate the rebellion in Shaanxi. Lacking weapons and personnel replenishment, they could not compete with the Japanese-equipped 'government army.' Some units broke into smaller groups to continue fighting in northern Shaanxi, while others chose to retreat to the northwest, crossing the Qilian Mountains, through the desert, to reach Xinjiang.\nDespite his advanced age, Bo Yibo remained vigorous.

The Western Expedition did not go smoothly. The Red Army, unfamiliar with the terrain, faced fierce resistance from the Ma family army, often risking total annihilation. However, thanks to the brave fighting of the soldiers and Li Xiannian's flexible command, the 30th Army first forced its way through the Yellow River, then fought fiercely between Liangzhou and Yongchang, killing over 4,000 enemies.\nAlthough the Western Expedition did not succeed in establishing a revolutionary base in Hexi, it opened the way to Xinjiang. In 1937, Li Xiannian led the remnants of the Western Expedition Army over the Qilian Mountains' watershed, marching for more than 20 days in the snow-covered peaks, then crossing the desolate Gobi Desert. By the end of April, they reached the Xingxing Gorge on the border between Gansu and Xinjiang. This unit became the backbone of the Communist Party's Xinjiang Bureau.\nIn 1938, as the War of Resistance intensified, Li Xiannian returned to northern Shaanxi.

In 1925, he participated in the May Thirtieth Movement. In August of the same year, he became the chairman of the strike committee of the Commercial Press Publishing House and led the strike. These movements were invariably crushed by the reactionaries' bloody suppression.

Until 1937, he arrived in Dihua, serving as the representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Xinjiang. At that time, the revolutionary situation in the northwest was volatile—the Western Route Army, though unsuccessful in establishing a base in Hexi, still sent timely support to the Xinjiang Party branch. At the same time, Xinjiang's ruler Sheng Shicai was pursuing a 'pro-Soviet and pro-Communist' policy, allowing the Party to operate openly in Xinjiang cities. From this perspective, the Party's prospects in Xinjiang seemed bright.\nSo, he requested permission from the Central Committee to stay in Xinjiang. Leveraging his abilities, he became Sheng Shicai's economic advisor, carefully nurturing the Party's strength in this frontier region for ten years. Twenty years passed in the blink of an eye. During this period, Marxism became widely accepted among Xinjiang's workers, but since trade with the Soviet Union was cut off, Xinjiang's industrial growth stagnated. Over the two decades, Sheng Shicai grew increasingly intolerant of Communist activities, gradually restricting the Party's room for maneuver. The Party's survival in Xinjiang became increasingly difficult, but the local proletariat's strength had already dwindled, insufficient to support a broad revolution.

However, one thing the Ma family does excel in compared to the central plains warlords is that whenever a great enemy appears, the believers will explode with surprising unity, no matter how deep their differences, they largely follow the leader's decision. This has been the case since the late Qing Dynasty.\nWhether faced with the Communists or the Nationalists, the Han or the Japanese invaders, Ma Bufang has carefully controlled the northwest's course. Sensing that the Japanese army was unwilling to launch a far-reaching expedition into Qinghai, Ma Bufang wisely preserved his strength, often setting aside Chongqing's telegrams. When the situation became clear, he decisively switched sides, allowing the northwest to catch the post-war economic recovery boom and creating the myth of prosperity known as the 'Jiangnan of the Northwest.'\nTime has passed, but Ma Bufang's rule remains unshakable.

MEN_batedaoerji: "Baatarjav Dorj"
MEN_batedaoerji_for_desc: "Baatarjav Dorj was originally a herder and later became a member of the Mongolian People's Army in the 1930s. He participated in all the battles against Japanese imperialism since the Battle of Nomonhan as a division commander. He witnessed the destruction of the Mongolian People's Republic and how the Kwantung Army planted the Rising Sun Flag on Sukhbaatar Square in Ulaanbaatar.\n\nAfter the fall of Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian army began a large-scale retreat. Although Baatarjav Dorj was only a mid-level officer, he successfully covered the retreat of the main Mongolian army. The fanaticism of the Japanese puppet troops caused heavy losses to Baatarjav Dorj's soldiers, but fortunately, the core personnel of the People's Army and government were successfully transferred. After this battle, Baatarjav Dorj entered a temporary military academy established by the Chinese Revolutionary Committee.\n\nNow, Baatarjav Dorj has become a representative of the young forces in the People's Army, and he can't wait to take revenge on the Japanese and Mongolian puppet troops."

MEN_zhamiyang_desc: "Jamiyan Lhagvasuren was born in 1912 into a military family. In 1932, at the age of 20, he enlisted and was assigned to the 15th Cavalry Division. In 1935, Lhagvasuren was selected to participate in an elite officer training program, and his promotion was swift. By July 1939, Lhagvasuren, as the commander of the Mongolian cavalry component of the 1st Soviet-Mongolian Group Army, participated in the Battle of Nomonhan under the direct command of Zhukov.\n\nIn the Battle of Nomonhan, Lhagvasuren witnessed the power of mechanized cavalry groups for the first time and secretly resolved to create a mechanized cavalry unit for Mongolia. However, the defeat of the Soviet Union and China forced Lhagvasuren to put his dreams aside and focus on survival. But if Mongolia is ever liberated, perhaps Lhagvasuren will have the opportunity to realize his dream."
MEN_gonggeer: "Shagdari Gongor"
MEN_gonggeer_desc: "Shagdari Gongor was born in 1912 into a herding family. In 1927, Gongor became a soldier in the Mongolian Cavalry Army, stationed on the border between the Mongolian People's Republic and Manchukuo. On January 28, 1936, at 7:30 p.m., while on guard duty, Gongor was attacked by more than ten Japanese cavalrymen. However, he did not retreat; instead, he fought the enemy alone for two hours. Because of this heroic combat experience, Gongor was awarded the title of 'Hero of the Republic' in the same month. In 1939, Gongor participated in the Battle of Nomonhan as the commander of an armored brigade. As the new force of the Mongolian army, Gongor's armored brigade was highly anticipated.\n\nUnlike other senior generals, Gongor did not long for the army or politics but rather yearned for a life of farming. After all, guns and cannons cannot make Mongolia prosperous. He had planned to retire as soon as the war was over, but the defeat of the Allies and neighboring countries forced him to postpone his plans—he would continue to fight until Mongolia was liberated."
