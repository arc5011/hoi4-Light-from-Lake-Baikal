# Liberation of Xinjiang National Focus Tree
	COX_Road_Back_Home: "Road Back Home"
	COX_Road_Back_Home_desc: "From the icy lands of Arkhangelsk, through the roaring underground cities of Tyumen, and the smoke-filled villages under Black Army control, all the way to the shores of Lake Baikal, the soldiers of the Chinese Brigade have crossed the vast snowy plains of Russia, seeking an opportunity to bring the Red Star back to their homeland. The bitter memories of the West Russian War have not diminished their revolutionary zeal, and the successive victories in Buryatia and the People's Revolutionary Council have further inspired their courage. What they have seen and heard along the way has only strengthened their resolve: the people must be completely liberated.\n\nNow, the opportunity to return home has suddenly appeared before us—Sheng Shicai and the crumbling military government are powerless to resist the Red Army's advance, handing over the Altay region. His corrupt rule is now counting down to its end. We must seize this opportunity and take the first step on the road back home by planting the Red Flag throughout Xinjiang!"
	COX_Mobilize_Xinjiang_Herdsman: "Mobilize the Xinjiang Herdsmen"
	COX_Mobilize_Xinjiang_Herdsman_desc: "Limited by the number of cadres, we have encountered expected difficulties in consolidating our governance around the Altay region. Unlike the affluent Han-populated areas of East Xinjiang, the Dihua military government has implemented a rather lax administration in the barren North Xinjiang. Captured village heads can only provide the names of a few tax-farming landlords, and are clueless about the number of villages under their control, let alone the agricultural situation. On the other hand, our veteran comrades in the Xinjiang branch, who have long been engaged in military propaganda work, have rarely left a few central towns and are also at a loss when it comes to the vast agricultural areas.\n\nIn this situation, we must quickly win the support of the Xinjiang herdsmen—they know the local conditions better than we do. Whether it's restoring economic order, stabilizing the situation, or cultivating local cadres in the future, we need their help."
	COX_Manage_The_Arsenal_In_Altay: "Inspect the Altay Arsenal"
	COX_Manage_The_Arsenal_In_Altay_desc: "Located on the border between Xinjiang and Western Mongolia, Altay is not a large or wealthy town, but it holds significant importance for Sheng Shicai and his military government. The Dihua authorities have built a large arsenal in Altay, with supplies capable of supporting hundreds of kilometers of border defense. This arsenal is the core of the northern Xinjiang defense line. To quickly rendezvous with us, the Xinjiang uprising forces have stored a large amount of heavy equipment in this arsenal and conducted a forced march. Now that the warlord forces have retreated from the Junggar region, it's time to open the doors and see how much good stuff hasn't been taken away."
	COX_March_Towards_Dihua: "March Towards Dihua!"
	COX_March_Towards_Dihua_desc: "Although the Xinjiang warlords control the largest territory among the warlords that emerged after the collapse of the Nanjing Nationalist Government, the area they actually control is quite limited. Apart from central cities like Dihua, Hami, and Turpan, the political situation in other areas hasn't changed much since the rule of Sheng Shicai years ago, still dominated by a mix of landlords and religious forces. Their power doesn't come from the military government, so they have no intention of maintaining Sheng Shicai's rule. As long as we seize several central towns in one go, the collapse of the military government will only be a matter of time.\n\n§RComrades, sharpen your steel guns and march towards Dihua!§!"
	COX_Bring_A_Spring_Of_Liberation: "Bring a Spring of Liberation"
	COX_Bring_A_Spring_Of_Liberation_desc: "Under the rule of the Dihua military government, the situation in Xinjiang hasn't fundamentally improved compared to twenty years ago, and in some areas, it has even worsened. Water conservancy projects are blocked, farmlands are salinized, and factories, with their low productivity, are even outcompeted by handicrafts—this is a wonder anywhere. The soldiers can ignore the people's life and death, but we are different. Our revolutionary army has always been the precursor of liberation for the people, both in Western Mongolia and in Xinjiang. We must bring the new voice and promises of socialism to the people here, oppressed by backward production relations, and inspire them to join the struggle for the liberation of all Xinjiang."
	COX_Propaganda_Against_Enemies: "Propaganda Against Enemy Troops"
	COX_Propaganda_Against_Enemies_desc: "Among Sheng Shicai's troops, many are soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army who fled to Xinjiang. Sheng Shicai has secured their loyalty with the promise that they would one day return to the Central Plains. However, year after year, the Xinjiang military government has not moved closer to the interior, instead becoming increasingly isolated beyond the Great Wall, with the opportunity to return home seeming like it will never come. Discontent from unfulfilled promises and the exile-like life has worn down the soldiers' patience. We can use this sentiment to avoid large-scale conflict with them and encourage their defection, thereby dealing a heavy blow to the Dihua authorities."
	COX_Far_From_Home: "For the Distant Homeland"
	COX_Far_From_Home_desc: "Since the Chongqing ceasefire in 1947, the echoes of revolutionary thunder have fallen silent across China for fifteen years, but the return of the Chinese Brigade is set to break this endless silence. For the Chinese soldiers, this is a grand march back to their homeland—the mountains and rivers of their homeland have been haunting their dreams, and the situation in their homeland has weighed heavily on their minds. The good days of autocratic warlords riding roughshod over the people are numbered—their forces have long been away from the hot soil, but now they return with the revolutionary spark."
	COX_For_The_Farmers_Who_Suffered: "For the Oppressed Farmers"
	COX_For_The_Farmers_Who_Suffered_desc: "The poor farmers of Xinjiang have lived under the oppression of dark feudal landlords and various ruling classes for thousands of years. For thousands of years, Xinjiang's agricultural producers have lived in constant fear, worried that they might not see the next day. But no matter how cautiously they tread, the reactionary rulers always find ways to squeeze 'oil and water' from them: a marriage tax for getting married, a commodity tax for buying grain tools, a construction tax for building houses... Meanwhile, the chaotic situation in Xinjiang only worsens their plight: landlord militias carve up territories, bandits run rampant, and extreme religious groups wreak havoc; the vast majority of Xinjiang's farmers are living in deep misery.\n\nOur task is to liberate Xinjiang and rescue its farmers from the iron grip of these oppressors!"
	COX_Our_Troop_Towards_The_Sun: "Our Troop Marches Towards the Sun"
	COX_Our_Troop_Towards_The_Sun_desc: "Despite being outnumbered and under-supplied, the revolution has triumphed. With the liberation of Dihua City, Sheng Shicai's rule over Xinjiang has crumbled. Our forces have traveled a long road, defeating the lackeys of imperialism both inside and outside, and have finally established a foothold in Xinjiang.\nFrom now on, the newly established Soviet government will lead the Chinese people in building, until all imperialism is defeated!"

# Second Land Reform Phase National Focus Tree
	COX_Joining_Force_In_Dihua: "Joining Forces in Dihua"
	COX_Joining_Force_In_Dihua_desc: "After clearing out the warlord resistance in Northern Xinjiang, the soldiers of the Chinese Brigade met with veteran comrades from the Xinjiang branch in Dihua. The fruits of victory are sweet indeed, the warlord rule is over, and Xinjiang has been liberated, but much work remains to be done—the situation in Southern Xinjiang is worrying, and the serfs' plight has not improved much with the victory of the war. Under the shadow of the Rising Sun, the Xinjiang base urgently needs development."
	COX_Joining_Force_In_Dihua.tt: "§RWe will soon engage in covert struggles and development in Japanese-controlled territory. Do not let the alert level exceed 100, or our red regime will face direct threats from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.§!"
	COX_A_New_Born_Government: "A New Born Government"
	COX_A_New_Born_Government_desc: "Sheng Shicai's rule is over. Now, the Communists have taken over Dihua City and the entire Xinjiang—though only nominally. The joy of victory did not last long. The revolutionaries soon realized that defeating Sheng Shicai's forces entrenched in Xinjiang was only the easiest step in liberating the region.\n\nThe Dihua City radio station broadcasts Mao Anying's speech from 48 hours ago non-stop, but the response across Xinjiang is sparse. It seems that transforming the vast, sparsely populated, ethnically complex, and feudal-entrenched Xinjiang into a base for liberating the entire Northwest and eventually all of China will be a long and challenging journey. But for the liberation of our homeland and in memory of the comrades who have already sacrificed, we must immediately get to work.\n\n§R'The iron-clad path is indeed formidable, yet now we stride forward anew.'§!"
	COX_Heavily_Restricted: "Heavily Restricted"
	COX_Heavily_Restricted_desc: "After securing Dihua City, the Chinese Brigade and the Xinjiang branch decided to go to the countryside, break the millennia-old facade of peaceful life, and reveal the brutal class struggle underneath, then mobilize the suffering people to rise and overthrow the oppressors.\n\n—Despite these ambitions, their work is not progressing smoothly. On one hand, this is due to the long-standing stigmatization of these atheists by the Bayi and Aho groups, as well as the ethnic divide between them. But more importantly, compared to Xinjiang's vast territory, the number of Chinese Brigade soldiers is too small. One by one, the soldiers are sent to remote villages, most returning empty-handed, while some arrogant Bayi even incite the masses to brutally execute the soldiers sent from Dihua.\n\n§RThe task is daunting, and time is running out. We must come up with better methods.§!"
	COX_Yanan_Lesson: "Never Forget Yan'an"
	COX_Yanan_Lesson_desc: "Our actions have encountered significant obstacles, but more dangerous than the spreading pessimism among comrades is the growing sense of distrust towards the masses. If we do not trust the masses, we will naturally not gain their trust. If we are abandoned by the masses, how can we call ourselves Communists? Comrade Mao Anying has summarized the various problems exposed in the rural movement over the past month and found that many soldiers still feel alienated from the local people. They see themselves, not the masses, as the primary force for liberation. This leads the masses to still view us as new rulers, not liberators. The long history of the Chinese revolution tells us that the people in the base areas are the core of the revolution. If we cannot fully mobilize them and have them consciously participate in the anti-imperialist struggle, the liberation of the entire country is out of the question.\n\nHaving identified the root of the problem, the Central Committee of the Xinjiang branch has decided to hold a meeting to rectify the work style of the cadres."
	COX_Flattened_Management: "Flattened Management"
	COX_Flattened_Management_desc: "Our current hierarchy largely follows the structure of the Chinese Brigade, but in the process of spreading the revolution, our soldiers have become scattered. Regiment commanders are often tens of kilometers away from the battalions they are supposed to command, which requires our comrades to have sufficient autonomy. This is to enable them to exercise their subjective initiative and adapt their work to local conditions in each village.\n\nOur country's revolution has many unique aspects, the most important of which is that the revolution originated in the countryside and took root there. This requires our cadres to be 'jack-of-all-trades' rather than relying on the highly organized bureaucratic systems like the Soviet Union. They may not be the most professional commanders or planned economy experts, but they can do almost anything, from mobilizing the masses to organizing guerrilla warfare. We will also encourage our soldiers to adapt to such roles."
	COX_Among_The_People: "Among the People"
	COX_Among_The_People_desc: "During the Yan'an period, unlike the arrogant Kuomintang officials and gentry, our Party was so deeply integrated with the masses that no one could distinguish a Communist from a hardworking farmer. Our Party members came from the masses and returned to the masses, enjoying deep support among them. This was the foundation of our ability to establish a solid base in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.\nFaced with the severe situation of the Xinjiang revolution, we must further promote the 'mass line'. Our soldiers will deeply engage with the rural masses, blending with them. Only in this way can we gradually establish our control over the grassroots and prepare for the next phase of work."
	COX_Reinforce_The_Base: "Begin Consolidating the Base"
	COX_Reinforce_The_Base_desc: "Although we have basically secured control over the Xinjiang region, it is far from being a revolutionary base. Reports on grassroots agricultural production and the miserable conditions of serfs are flooding into Dihua like snowflakes, while the exploiters continue to flaunt their power locally. In their view, we are just another Sheng Shicai-style regime, and they expect us to bow to them sooner or later. Judging from the current situation, a thorough land revolution is imminent, and the work of liquidating landlords and liberating serfs is imperative.\n\nIf all goes well, by the end of the revolution, Xinjiang will become a solid rear base for our cause."
	COX_To_The_Fields: "To the Fields"
	COX_To_The_Fields_desc: "Now, our cadres have been dispatched and stationed in villages across Xinjiang. But this does not mean that the people of Xinjiang have been liberated. Just as during Sheng Shicai's rule, the landlord class still runs rampant in the countryside, and the farmers are still suffering from oppressive policies. We must conduct a land revolution, just as we did in northern Shaanxi and southern Jiangxi, and this land revolution must be based on a deep understanding of land relations and exploitation relations.\n\nTo this end, comrades stationed in various villages will immediately carry out extensive investigations, recording the number of hired laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, rich peasants, and landlords in each village, as well as the amount of land they own and the common means of exploitation used by the landlord class."
	COX_Protect_The_Results: "Protect the Achievements"
	COX_Protect_The_Results_desc: "We must admit that the political environment in Southern Xinjiang is far worse than we had imagined. The serf landlord group decisively abandoned Sheng Shicai when he began to fail and raised the banner of rebellion, which means that the reactionary forces in Southern Xinjiang still retain considerable energy—this is their usual self-preservation tactic when regimes change. Currently, the Soviets and they maintain a precarious peace, but as the land revolution progresses, this state is bound to be short-lived.\n\nHoping that the serf landlords will voluntarily hand over land is nothing but a fool's dream, and when these landlords have private armed forces, the situation becomes even more dangerous. To protect the gains of the reform from possible backlash, we must act quickly."
	COX_Account_The_Water_Conservancy: "Survey Water Conservancy"
	COX_Account_The_Water_Conservancy_desc: "Before the liberation, Xinjiang had many water conservancy projects. But the old government built these facilities not to improve people's lives but to collude with the landlord class and line their own pockets. As a result, few of these water facilities are now functional. The Minzu Canal in Topke Village, Yecheng County, is a typical example. Villagers say, 'We dug the canal for thirty years, filled the landlords' pockets, and ruined the men of our households.' For thirty years, the ruling class exploited the name of canal digging to levy taxes and labor, impoverishing the people while the waterway remained unfinished. Given this, the water conservancy statistics left by the Sheng Shicai era must be viewed with suspicion. Our work teams have already set out and will survey the water conservancy situation throughout Xinjiang. In a few weeks, we expect to have a relatively more accurate and reliable report."
	COX_Lower_The_Rent_And_Fight_The_Local_Bully: "Reduce Rent and Combat Local Bullies"
	COX_Lower_The_Rent_And_Fight_The_Local_Bully_desc: "Although heavy rent is just one of the many oppressions faced by the people of Xinjiang, our experience in southern Jiangxi and northern Shaanxi shows that what the farmers resent most is having the fruits of their hard labor taken away by others for free. The rent reduction and anti-bullying campaign can serve as a breakthrough point for the land revolution. We can initially mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants, allowing them to fight for the improvement of their living conditions. Meanwhile, those who openly oppose us—agricultural landlords and religious landholders—will also be targeted. Through this campaign, the laboring masses will be educated for the first time—realizing the immense power they hold in their hands."
	COX_Training_The_Militia: "Train the Militia"
	COX_Training_The_Militia_desc: "Under Sheng Shicai's regime, many progressives in Xinjiang were brutally suppressed. If we want to carry the land revolution to the end, we must rely on the people's strength. We should organize the newly empowered farmers locally into trained militias so that we can consolidate the achievements of the land reform on every front and closely monitor the movements of reactionary elements. Meanwhile, we can also bring militias from more stable areas back to Dihua for further training to prepare for any eventualities."
	COX_Popularize_The_Karez: "Popularize the Karez"
	COX_Popularize_The_Karez_desc: "For centuries, the Karez has been widely used in the Xinjiang region. This irrigation technique is essentially an underground canal that channels groundwater or seasonal glacier meltwater into a transport canal, then into an open canal for irrigation. While the Karez offers many benefits, it is ultimately a large-scale project. Whether it is locating a water-bearing stratum or excavating hundreds of meters of underground channels, these are tasks beyond the reach of ordinary agricultural producers. If an agricultural village cannot reach a consensus on whether to dig an underground canal or lacks sufficient manpower, the Karez cannot be built. Now, the Soviets will solve this problem for their people. Our work teams, with ample financial support, will lead the local people in digging Karez canals across the entire Xinjiang region."
	COX_Public_Water: "Public Water Management"
	COX_Public_Water_desc: "Every township in Xinjiang has specialized water conservancy personnel responsible for maintaining water supply facilities and, in water-scarce areas, for distributing water sources. However, the collusion between rulers and the landlord class has kept these positions in the hands of the corrupt. They arbitrarily withhold farmers' water in exchange for bribes, leaving the farmers without enough water for irrigation and even struggling to survive, forcing them to rely more heavily on the landlord class.\n\nAs a result, more and more land in Xinjiang has become barren, and the people remain under the shadow of famine. Building water conservancy facilities is not something that can be done overnight. We can start by replacing these corrupt officials with fair and just water conservancy personnel who have some reputation in the villages. They will distribute water based on the type and amount of land, making reasonable use of the existing water conservancy facilities."
	COX_Liberate_The_Serf: "Eradicate the Legacy of Serfdom"
	COX_Liberate_The_Serf_desc: "Serfdom is widespread in Xinjiang. Under this system, serf owners occupy large estates and rely on the unpaid labor of serfs for their enjoyment. When cultivating the landlord's land, serfs often work passively, while on the other hand, their own land suffers from various problems leading to poor harvests. This has kept the people of Xinjiang in a state of perpetual hunger. We must go further and abolish this severely outdated system. Serfs will gain personal freedom and enough land to cultivate."
	COX_Abolish_The_Privilege_Of_Religion: "Abolish Religious Privileges"
	COX_Abolish_The_Privilege_Of_Religion_desc: "For a long time, Islam, which advocates brotherhood among believers, has degenerated into a tool of oppression against the people. The Aho group, in collusion with serf owners, has formed the ruling class of Xinjiang, placing heavy shackles on the serfs and farmers across the region. The people must be liberated from this religious oppression, but if implemented too quickly, it could push a significant portion of the population into opposition against us. Therefore, we must both divide the Aho group and expose their true nature to the people."
	COX_Rehabilitate_Agricultural_Economy: "Revitalize Agricultural Economy"
	COX_Rehabilitate_Agricultural_Economy_desc: "Xinjiang's agricultural production may lack people and land, but most of all, it lacks water. To address irrigation issues, the Soviets have made considerable efforts, and the results we have achieved are indeed promising. The glacial meltwater allocated by the water conservancy department, along with the extensive Karez canals, now form a new source of agricultural water supply. Water bullies, who long exploited the people and sold water resources at exorbitant prices, have been uprooted during the reform. Xinjiang's once severe irrigation problem has now been alleviated. Farmers who once left their homes due to the lack of irrigation water are now returning to the land that had been abandoned. This means that our agricultural population and arable land area have both increased, making the recovery of Xinjiang's agricultural economy foreseeable."
	COX_Battle_The_Landlord_Troops: "Crush the Landlord Militias"
	COX_Battle_The_Landlord_Troops_desc: "In the disintegration of China's natural economy, coupled with natural and man-made disasters, the situation of 'No Gentry, No Power; No Power, No Villainy' has naturally arisen. The same is true in Xinjiang, where 'private soldiers' or 'family retainers' organized by a few large landlords have always terrorized the countryside, subjecting those who defy them to various tortures. They are the fundamental reliance of the landlord class in their brutal exploitation of the peasants. They are a formidable force, and if we want the land reform to continue, we must crush this iron tooth of the landlords."
	COX_Battle_The_Religious_Force: "Crush the Religious Militias"
	COX_Battle_The_Religious_Force_desc: "Religious militias are deeply tied to feudal land ownership, i.e., landlords and the estate economy of temples. They are part of a tightly interwoven feudal patriarchal mobilization system, led by the elder chiefs of large Uyghur and Kazakh clans, with large estate and ranch owners providing money and grain, while religious figures convey the will of the Almighty, fervently inciting ignorant young men to bleed for the interests of the ruling class.\nWe must admit that religion has a natural mobilizing power, and given time, countless devout warriors will emerge from the once peaceful mosques. To ensure the smooth progress of the land reform, we must strike a heavy blow against the religious militias."
	COX_Redistribution_Of_The_Means_Of_Production: "Redistribution of the Means of Production"
	COX_Redistribution_Of_The_Means_Of_Production_desc: "The results of our abolition of serfdom and rent reduction have not been ideal. Many peasants have received their own land, but they lack the necessary means of production, and some do not even have a sickle for weeding. The only tool they have is a worn-out hoe. The land they have received is often difficult to cultivate Gobi desert or scattered small plots. Over time, the phenomenon of land consolidation is bound to occur, and the entire outcome of the land reform will be in vain. To consolidate the hard-won liberation, we must redistribute the tools, livestock, and land held by the rich peasants, landlords, and mosques to the poor and lower-middle peasants, leaving the former oppressors with just enough to support themselves."
	COX_Achievement_Of_The_Second_Land_Reform: "Achievements of the Second Land Reform"
	COX_Achievement_Of_The_Second_Land_Reform_desc: "After months of hard work by our comrades and the relentless efforts of the people across Xinjiang, the region has undergone a profound transformation—serfs have been liberated, water supply has been secured, and religion has been reformed. We have essentially achieved the goals of the land revolution. Now, in Xinjiang, farmers have their own land, self-sufficient smallholders are no longer exploited by landlords, nor are they burdened by heavy labor. They also have access to sufficient water, greatly increasing their production enthusiasm, and grain production throughout Xinjiang has generally doubled.\nAlthough this smallholder economy is still far from a truly socialist economy, through this movement, our revolution has firmly taken root. Now, the revolution can finally take the next step."

	COX_A_Base_New_Born: "A Newly Born Base"
	COX_A_Base_New_Born_desc: "The land revolution has triumphed! Through the tireless efforts of countless cadres sent to the countryside and the common people, the feudal landlord class that once oppressed the people of Xinjiang and the imams who enslaved them through religion have been swept into the dustbin of history. Our Xinjiang base is now completely renewed, with farmers working passionately on their own land. The base has undergone a complete transformation!"

	COX_Inspect_The_Army: "Review the Revolutionary Army"
	COX_Inspect_The_Army_desc: "Thanks to the smooth implementation of land reform and political reforms, Xinjiang is no longer a petty kingdom ruled by a warlord. People of all ethnic groups live and work in peace, united in their efforts to build the Soviet Union. The troops previously dispersed to maintain stability and combat bad elements have completed their tasks and are returning to Dihua one by one. After a short rest, they will resume their daily training exercises. The Soviets plan to hold a military parade soon, where we will once again assess our revolutionary army and demonstrate our confidence and ability to defend the revolution to the people of Xinjiang."

	COX_Commend_Our_Men: "Commend Heroes and Role Models"
	COX_Commend_Our_Men_desc: "During the long and arduous land revolution, countless heroic and touching stories emerged, along with numerous exemplary heroes and models. These advanced figures of land reform deserve recognition, to remember the hardships of the past and to look forward to the new life we are about to embrace."

	COX_Evaluate_Industry_Level: "Evaluate Current Industrial Status"
	COX_Evaluate_Industry_Level_desc: "When Sheng Shicai retreated to Xinjiang, he brought with him some of the Nationalist Party's legacy, making the industrial construction in Xinjiang significantly better than other warlord-controlled areas. However, this foundation cannot last forever. According to the annual industrial output reports we found in Dihua, industrial production in Xinjiang has already fallen into negative growth. Furthermore, previous Uyghur insurgents and Turkestan separatists have indiscriminately damaged industrial facilities in various places, rendering many factories irreparable. To assess the current industrial situation in the areas we control, a thorough inspection is imperative."

	COX_A_Letter_To_General_Baurjan: "A Letter to General Baurjan"
	COX_A_Letter_To_General_Baurjan_desc: "Only through practice in real combat can one truly qualify as a commander. To the west of our base, Marshal Baurjan's Kazakh Red Army is stationed, currently troubled by rampant bandits within their territory. This presents an excellent opportunity to train our commanders in combat skills.\n\nWe will send a letter to Marshal Baurjan, an old comrade of the Chinese Brigade, requesting to enter their territory under the banner of communist solidarity to assist them in eradicating the bandits. During this process, our new commanders will also gain valuable experience. This will be a mutually beneficial endeavor, and we believe the Kazakh Red Army will be very willing to accept our assistance."

	COX_A_Tough_Decision: "A Tough Decision"
	COX_A_Tough_Decision_desc: "Some former officers who served Sheng Shicai have proven untrustworthy, and the Soviets need a new batch of commanders to lead the revolutionary army forward. However, Xinjiang lacks any military academy, and training military personnel from scratch would be too slow to address our immediate needs. Therefore, we must look to the comrades of the Chinese Brigade—they have rich combat experience and firm revolutionary beliefs and can be trained quickly to take on grassroots command roles. Many old comrades may be reluctant to leave their fighting units and comrades-in-arms, making this a difficult decision for both them and us. However, for the bright future of the revolutionary cause, this is a sacrifice that must be made.\n\nWe will select experienced veterans from the Chinese Brigade and train them to become commanders."

	COX_Expand_The_Party_Branch: "Expand the Party Branch"
	COX_Expand_The_Party_Branch_desc: "Establishing branches at the grassroots level has always been a fine tradition of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Now that Sheng Shicai's old troops have been reorganized into the combat ranks of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, we must naturally extend the Party branches to these new troops, propagating socialist ideas and guiding them to become Communist Party members. For many soldiers who once served warlords, political life was far removed, and they did not understand what they were fighting for, merely muddling through day by day. This state of affairs must change. Under the leadership of the Party branch, they will grow into knowledgeable and disciplined Red Army soldiers. Warlords may treat people like dogs, but we will restore their humanity."

	COX_Consultations_with_Xinmeng: "Consultations with Xinmeng"
	COX_Consultations_with_Xinmeng_desc: "Despite the betrayal and fall of Chongqing leading to our homeland becoming a complete colony, the seeds of patriotic democratic thought have never been eradicated. Xinjiang's native communists, who suffered setbacks during the unsuccessful Three Districts Revolution, formed the backbone of the Socialist Democratic Party, the 'Xinjiang Alliance for Peace and Democracy,' opposing the warlord government's dictatorship. The Party's Xinjiang branch had extensive contact with them before the general uprising, and the victory of the armed struggle and the smooth progress of land reform have attracted many democrats to leave the occupied areas and come to the frontier. For an independent, united, and democratic new China, we must unite as one to see the dawn at the end of the darkness."

	COX_Talks_With_The_Old_Uighurs: "Talks with the Old Uighurs"
	COX_Talks_With_The_Old_Uighurs_desc: "Thanks to the relentless efforts of the working people, cadres at all levels, and patriotic religious figures, extremism and other reactionary ideas have been largely eliminated from Islam in Xinjiang. However, even the most supportive of the Party's leadership among the believers and imams have concerns: What will ultimately become of religion under the Soviets? Will Xinjiang eventually become a land where not a single mosque is allowed to stand? To alleviate their concerns, we have arranged for meetings with patriotic religious leaders who have always supported the Party's religious policies, to explain the Party's long-term religious policy and solemnly promise that as long as they do not cross the red line, religious beliefs and freedoms across China will be protected by the Soviet government and socialist law."

	COX_Fix_The_Old_Paths_In_Xinjiang: "Repair the Old Roads"
	COX_Fix_The_Old_Paths_In_Xinjiang_desc: "Xinjiang has had several major trade routes since ancient times, and in the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, the government also built several roads. However, due to a lack of maintenance, they are now almost unusable. Therefore, one of the key tasks for the base government is to repair these roads. The benefits of road repairs are numerous, and any effort made to develop and build Xinjiang is worthwhile."

	COX_Temporary_Industry_Committee: "Establish Temporary Industry Committee"
	COX_Temporary_Industry_Committee_desc: "Agricultural production can be carried out in small communes or production organizations, but large-scale industrial production cannot. While receiving and rebuilding Xinjiang's industrial equipment and organizations, we should also establish a committee specifically for industrial production, to coordinate the management and introduction of industrial equipment, worker education, and most other related affairs. While this organization may need restructuring in the future, its existence is currently necessary."

The incorrigible troublemakers have been swiftly expelled, new commanders have been gradually put in place, and we can finally proudly declare that the remnants of reactionary elements have been thoroughly purged. These former bandits have been transformed into a new army with organization and discipline. Although their ideological transformation will take some more time, it is only a matter of time. This morning, Comrade Mao Anying, on behalf of the Mongolia-Xinjiang Soviet, awarded them their new designations in Dihua, encouraging them to train hard and fight bravely to defend the revolutionary base. From now on, these troops will fight alongside the Chinese Brigade, adding another layer of security to our base."

The Xinjiang People's Political Consultative Conference, led by the Party, will adopt a common program through the conference, elect the formal Soviet government, and assume legislative and supervisory responsibilities. The improvement of the administrative system will also be promoted with the assistance and supervision of the People's Political Consultative Conference. The establishment of the Xinjiang People's Political Consultative Conference marks the true consolidation of power in the liberated area and signifies that we have raised the torch of liberation high in the dark land of China."

Despite this, we will not sit idly by. We will focus on human factors, improving the quality of our soldiers to ensure that we do not fall behind on the battlefield.\n\nSince the founding of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, mobile warfare has been the core of our military strategy, and it is still not outdated, nor should we abandon it. Mobile warfare training will be resumed, with soldiers crossing complex terrain faster than the enemy to reach planned combat locations, executing fierce encirclement tactics against the enemy. Soon, our enemies will find that the Soviet army will appear from positions they could never have imagined, rendering all attempts to flee on foot futile. Whether in mountains, hills, or the vast Gobi Desert, these imperialist dogs will have no chance of escape."

This unit was founded by Russian émigré Pathih Mosrimov in 1946, who once drove out Xinjiang warlords but was later defeated by Sheng Shicai, with Mosrimov dying in battle. The unit then continued to engage in guerrilla activities against the warlords' brutal rule within Xinjiang. On the eve of the Mongolian People's Front's war against Mengjiang, the new leader Abbasov led the unit to Ulaanbaatar to help the Front resist the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere invasion. However, with the defeat of the war and their retreat cut off, the Gongha Guerrilla Unit was forced to remain in Mengjiang, fighting while retreating toward Xinjiang. Now that the warlord forces that once plagued Xinjiang have been swept away, the task of securing cooperation between the Gongha Guerrilla Unit and the Soviets has become a priority. A working group has already been dispatched to Mengjiang to liaise with Abbasov. If negotiations succeed, we will send troops to the border to meet the guerrilla unit and bring the wandering exiles back home."

This system played an important role in the smooth implementation of land reform and the suppression of reactionary elements roaming the countryside. However, with the completion of land reform and the basic victory of the anti-revolutionary suppression, the associations have not yet transitioned from being organizations for struggle to organizations for democratic production and living. Some associations have acted too aggressively in production construction, or 'failed to distinguish between internal contradictions among the people and contradictions between us and the enemy.'

However, we must also recognize that the land we stand on has been home to many ethnic groups since ancient times. As members of the greater Chinese family, their history, culture, and languages must be respected. In addition to promoting the common Chinese language in literacy campaigns, all national languages in Xinjiang will be legally protected. Children will be able to learn both their native languages and Chinese in school, and government documents will be bilingual.

Throughout China's millennia-long history, religion has often been the narcotic used by the ruling class to numb the people and the sacred cover to mask bloody exploitation. However, the existence of religion has its historical inevitability and rationality, and it will not disappear from the minds of the people simply by an order from the Party. We have already made remarkable achievements in preventing religion from becoming the sword of reactionary forces during the land reform. Now, in the name of the working people, we will formally establish guidelines to regulate the behavior of religious organizations, completing the transformation of Xinjiang's religious organizations from tools of oppression by the ruling class to patriotic organizations of mutual assistance for the working people, and implementing the principle of separation of church and state. Achieving this completely will take a long time, but we have the confidence and ability to do so."

This is a serious obstacle to industrial construction. We have two solutions to this problem: first, we will summarize and share the production experiences of our local workers; second, we will humbly seek guidance from our comrades to the north. However, regardless of the solution, we need to establish a specialized agency to oversee the re-education of workers."

However, compared to the vast land and numerous ethnic minority people in Xinjiang, our Party members are not only few in number but are mostly Han Chinese from the east or from Xinjiang's major cities. Although ethnic minority people have no complaints about Han Party members, the lack of Party members and the gaps in habits, language, and even appearance undoubtedly create additional challenges in reaching the masses. Fortunately, during the land reform, we established many Party schools and various theory classes to train local Party members and cadres, and the Youth League has also widely recruited young people who are determined to devote their lives to the communist cause. With these reserve forces, it's only a matter of time before the Party organization truly 'connects with the people.'"

The qualifications of the new generation of religious personnel need to be reviewed by the Soviet government's national and religious affairs department. They should love their motherland, love the people, support the revolution, have strong religious knowledge, and be proficient in scientific knowledge. Under the Party's guidance, the new generation of religious personnel will be trained to become qualified builders of socialism, protectors and researchers of religious cultural heritage, and work together with Party cadres to serve the people."

However, given the current situation in Xinjiang, individual farmers cannot afford a tractor, nor do they have enough land to fully utilize its power. Tractors are best suited for large farms. However, most of Xinjiang has only recently completed the land revolution, and farmers have only just received their land, making it difficult to find large, contiguous rural areas in Xinjiang.\nFortunately, in some areas where we completed the land revolution earlier, and in oasis farms, some have already begun to establish cooperatives under the encouragement of agricultural societies. We can promote tractors in these areas to improve our agricultural production levels."

The Chinese Brigade and other units have been reorganized into the First Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, with Comrade Mao Anying serving as the army commander and Comrade Liu Shaoqi as the political commissar, both nominations unanimously approved within the Party.\n\nHaving endured forty years of fire and blood, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, once in dire straits, has risen again from the depths, reborn. The enduring struggle continues, and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army will fight the Japanese invaders and their warlord henchmen to the end for the liberation of the entire nation and the rights of the proletariat.

For a Communist Party and a vanguard to seek equality and liberation for the people, continuous self-reflection and self-purification are necessary. Since the establishment of the base, the Party's membership has rapidly expanded, but among the new blood, there inevitably exist those who deviate from the correct line, harbor distorted thoughts, or exhibit improper conduct. Movement-style rectification campaigns are insufficient to ensure the Party's dual purity in thought and conduct over the long term. We must persistently educate Party members and let the people supervise their conduct. Of course, all levels of leadership—including Comrade Mao Anying himself—must set an example for Party members by voluntarily accepting supervision from the entire population and humbly accepting suggestions and criticism."

Now that the land revolution has ended in victory, we should regularize and institutionalize these already organized Red Guards militias, training the farmer brothers during the off-season and establishing a comprehensive Red Guards militia system. This can effectively enhance our troop mobilization system and allow the Red Guards to make up for some of the shortcomings of the regular Red Army, acting as auxiliary forces."

This economy is not only unstable but also yields poor output. It seems that long-term land division cannot increase grain production, so what can be relied on? It should probably be fertilizers, but for now, the base simply cannot produce fertilizers on the same scale as Western industrialized countries. However, through centuries of practical labor, the working people across Xinjiang have developed many methods for producing fertilizers using local materials, such as the most common method of composting with manure.\nIn addition, Xinjiang has abundant coal mines, and we can try to coke the coal. During the coking process, a small amount of ammonia is generated because coal contains a certain amount of nitrogenous heterocycles, and during the coking process, these nitrogen elements are released in the form of ammonia gas, mixed in the coke oven gas. Before the invention of synthetic ammonia, humanity extracted small amounts of fertilizer in this way. Nowadays, the factories in Dihua can use this primitive method to produce a small amount of fertilizer.\nFurthermore, Xinjiang has several salt lakes, from which nitrates can be extracted. We can mobilize and educate farmers living near the salt lakes to extract nitrates as raw materials for local fertilizers."

This migration has gradually turned the once fertile Central Plains into a wasteland. Millions of people have left their homes and families behind, seeking refuge in the western provinces to escape the guns and bayonets of the Japanese army. Even today, many are still looking for a place to settle—they camp under the open sky, risking their lives to cross the dangerous northwest deserts, all the way to Xinjiang.\nAs border controls gradually improve, we will dispatch personnel specifically responsible for resettling the migrating population.

Adding to the woes is the fact that we have almost no direct contact with any government to conceal our presence from Japanese imperialists, yet the technology needed for industrialization must be obtained from external sources.\nTo liberate the people of the whole country, we must continue forward—not by advancing east, but by looking northward to the Russian land, seeking contact with our comrades.

However, the region's economic level is clearly insufficient to support the massive expansion costs. The good news is that our neighbors in Central Asia can provide these resources—with the defeat of the Soviet Union, the people's living standards have rapidly declined, as has electricity consumption. This decline has led to the idling of many power generation facilities. Instead of letting these facilities gather dust and rust in power plants or even be dismantled, it would be better for the regional government to lease them at a reasonable price."

During Sheng Shicai's regime, there was no emphasis on establishing unified industrial product standards; instead, he introduced corresponding industries based on political expediency. This has resulted in a significant mix of Soviet and Japanese equipment in our current base. The mixed use of old and new production standards has led to inconsistent product quality and specifications, which seriously affects production safety. This issue was negligible when productivity was low, but with the expansion of industrial zones and the reconstruction of factories, we urgently need to unify all production processes. Therefore, the quickest solution is to seek cooperation with governments willing to share their production experience, from Central Siberia to Central Asia.

We can apply our past experience in land reform in Xinjiang to Qinghai, accelerating the process of land revolution in Qinghai while preventing the tragedies that occurred during Xinjiang's land reform.\nSimilar to Xinjiang, the northern border near the grasslands is dominated by pastoralism. The reforms in pastoral areas can also be guided by Xinjiang's valuable experience, leading the herders onto the path of collective production."

XBJ_Pursue_The_Aggressors: "Pursue the Bandits"
XBJ_Pursue_The_Aggressors_desc: "Years of war have destroyed the production order in the northwest, and the resulting famine has given rise to refugees and bandits. Although the people of the northwest have organized Red Guards and driven bandits away from their villages, the towering mountains of the northwest provide excellent hiding places for bandits. They gather in the mountains, raiding nearby villages during the busy farming season, severely threatening the safety of the people of Qinghai and normal production activities, which could ultimately undermine our efforts in Qinghai.\nAs long as the bandits remain, the people will not have peace. We must mobilize the Red Army to thoroughly crush their strongholds."

XBJ_Take_Over_Chamber_Of_Commerce_desc: "To attract investments from mainland merchants, the Ma family once allowed the establishment of chambers of commerce. During times of economic prosperity, even though the profits from the tea-horse trade mostly flowed into the coffers of 'Huangzhong Industry,' most chambers of commerce could still enjoy a share of the profits. However, in the turmoil of the 1960s, countless small chambers of commerce have gone bankrupt or are on the verge of bankruptcy. Overall, their assets are still quite substantial. We can negotiate acquisition deals with these merchants, introducing them to alternative routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and reviving the industries in their hands."

XBJ_Nationalized_Huangzhong: "Nationalize Huangzhong Industrial Co., Ltd."
XBJ_Nationalized_Huangzhong_desc: "Huangzhong Industrial Company was formed when Ma Bufang merged the two largest trading firms in the northwest, creating a monopoly institution. Through this institution, the Ma family was able to monopolize economic exchanges between the three northwest provinces and the mainland for twenty years, known as the 'tea-horse trade.' This company generated exorbitant profits for the Ma family and represented their brutal exploitation of the people of the northwest. Although the servants installed by the Ma family in the upper echelons are unforgivable, most grassroots members were simply following orders. By conducting ideological work with them, we can further nationalize Huangzhong Industry and use it to benefit all the people of the northwest."

XBJ_Crack_Down_On_Iman_System_desc: "During the spread of Islam to the northwest, Sufi scholars from Central Asia established the Menhuan system. In addition to studying the Quran and following the Hadith like other sects, this branch of Sufism also promoted the deification of the religious leader, requiring followers to unconditionally obey the leader's orders and worship tombs known as 'Gongbei' for generations. The religious leader's position is inherited, and the family often becomes large feudal landlords. We must completely bury this decadent ideology and liberate the people from their mental shackles."

Invaders, warlords, and bureaucrats have been swept away. Although the road ahead is long, this ancient and broken land will eventually be reborn.\nThe Soviet government will be established on this land, bringing prosperity and stability to its people."

We don't know what has delayed these wolves, preventing them from smelling the scent of blood and taking advantage of the situation to invade Xining, but their attack is inevitable. To protect the newly established Northwest Soviet regime, we must take precautions, build new defensive lines, and repair the fortresses abandoned during the chaos. We must resist the Japanese offensive!"

However, we cannot stop here. Internal and external enemies are watching us, and we must continue to develop the strength of the Soviet area and consolidate its rule. Although many hold the opinion that as an agricultural country, China should focus on improving the living standards of farmers, the Party Central Committee remains determined to launch the first five-year plan to truly possess the power to liberate the entire country. Let the reactionaries at home and abroad say what they will."

COX_Pilot_Cultural_Collectivization_desc: "At all times, food is the most important thing. While our current food supply is much greater than before, it is still only barely enough to ensure subsistence. Therefore, in accordance with the needs of the five-year plan, we have decided to attempt collectivizing the agricultural land of the people, to be farmed collectively by the peasants. On the one hand, this will make it easier for us to know what problems are occurring on any given piece of land, and it will be less cumbersome to deal with them. On the other hand, reclaiming private land as public can also, to some extent, strike a blow against the remnants of the feudal forces. The benefits are many, but we still need to first experiment with collectivization in some areas, then record or estimate any potential problems that may arise, to leave behind valuable and real experience for deeper agricultural reforms in the future."

COX_Set_Up_Bayi_School_desc: "As the pilot projects for agricultural collectivization gradually progress, we need to address another issue: previously, our pitiful amount of agricultural machinery was fully sufficient for the small number of people who could operate them. Now, however, the production capacity of agricultural machinery has increased, but the number of farmers skilled in operating these machines has not increased much, leading to frequent accidents caused by unfamiliarity. The same situation has occurred with ordinary agricultural tools, such as the use of pesticides, farming methods, and fertilizers. Therefore, we need to establish a unified educational facility to attract people in various feasible ways and provide them with agricultural re-education. At the same time, we must also find ways to attract advanced farmers to help compensate for the inevitable lack of experience we will encounter."

COX_Agricultural_Water_Supply_System_desc: "During the land reform period, we worked hard to build water conservancy projects in Xinjiang. To this day, these achievements continue to benefit the local people, but it is clear that more needs to be done. Although the people of Xinjiang generally have a simple awareness of water conservation, water resources are still being wasted; at the same time, water production capacity can be further increased. Therefore, with the initial establishment of the industrial system, we can slightly expand the existing wells and implement more systematic water distribution measures. On the other hand, we also need to improve water-intensive production methods, such as flood irrigation."

But now that the Soviet area is transitioning to construction, the low cultural level of the base area will increasingly hinder our development. How can we establish a basic industrial foundation if cadres cannot read a single character? How can we gradually eliminate the influence of religion on the people if they remain ignorant and backward? A literacy campaign is urgently needed. We must prioritize improving cultural standards and transform the Soviet area into a vast school."

COX_Secure_Cement_Supply_desc: "Given the actual situation in the northwest Soviet area, heavy industry is not a priority in the five-year plan. As a crucial building material, we must increase cement production to meet the needs of expanding cities and workshops, as well as fortification construction on the border. Therefore, in addition to expanding the existing cement plants in Urumqi and Xining, we also need to introduce equipment from the Soviet Union to build new cement plants. These new industrial areas will be dispersed and concealed among the mountains surrounding the cities, ready to switch to wartime production at any moment."

Now, the Soviet area has ample cement, solid steel, and the wisdom of the people. When these three elements combine, we can ensure that the benefits of industrial development are promptly extended to the vast number of farmers. By modifying and replicating former Soviet equipment, we will build the first factory capable of mass-producing agricultural tractors in Urumqi.

On the other hand, our current technology seems inadequate for oil extraction, let alone the fact that for the Xinjiang base area, 'oil extraction' is something entirely new. But if even the Republic of China can do it, then there is reason to believe we can too, and the workers are eager to get started after the discovery of oil deposits.

Even the most optimistic estimates regard the chances of the 'National Protection Army' as quite slim, seeing it as merely Long Yun's 'military adventurism.' However, when the call for national resistance from the Southwest Central Committee arrived, we still gathered our forces and launched an attack on the Northwest Army entrenched in Lanzhou...\n\nDespite our heavy losses in that war, which caused the newly established base to fall into crisis, what surprised everyone was that under the oppression of the Japanese invaders, sparks of resistance ignited across the nation. The National Protection Army advanced triumphantly, liberating most of South China. When the news of Nanjing's liberation reached the Northwest, the Soviet area was invigorated. Although the Northwest has not yet emerged from the embers of war, in this war concerning the fate of the entire nation, we must move forward together with determination!"

But the heroic working class will defeat all conspiracies and schemes! Let the enemy know that their old order has decayed, and we, the proletariat, have the determination and ability to create a new world!"

COX_Light_The_Fire: "Stoke the Flames!"
COX_Light_The_Fire_desc: "Since the 19th century, the importance of industrial production in war has been self-evident. The Northwest still lacks a systematic industry, and all we can do is make full use of the resources at hand. The few production lines will be moved to the mountains, where they will be sheltered by the steep mountains of the Northwest and protected from enemy destruction. The workers will be organized and mobilized for wartime production. Steel and wood, sulfur and saltpeter—though small in number, they will flow continuously into the production line. Through continuous production, they will eventually join the iron stream of resistance against Japan, transforming into bullets aimed at the enemy's heart!"

Soon, you will step onto the real battlefield, battling to the death against the evil Japanese imperialists. Indeed, the invaders are equipped with the world's most advanced weaponry—they have tanks, automatic rifles, and jet planes. But weapons are not the only factor that determines the outcome of war. Did not the puppet army, armed with Japanese weapons, already lose to the National Protection Army that rose from a corner of Yunnan?\n\nMany of you here fled to this place thirty years ago, but now, the horn of national resistance has sounded once again!

At this time, the 'Red Army' in the Northwest is more like a rough fusion of Xinjiang and Qinghai's armies. By conventional reasoning, such a force, composed of diverse ethnic groups and even holding ideological differences, would inevitably be rife with contradictions and conflicts, making coordinated action nearly impossible. But the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War gave the Red Army and the Ning faction a common goal. Under the banner of resistance, the soldiers who witnessed Japanese atrocities in Lanzhou united, casting aside their ethnic and religious differences. Each one holds their rifle tightly, swearing to fight the invaders to the death!"

Before us are the same bandits—they seize land with guns and cannons, raise lackeys, and then recline in their armchairs, contentedly sucking the blood of all Asia!\n\nIn the East, there are still hundreds of millions of compatriots living under such tragic oppression. Peasant comrades, can you bear this? Since we have already overthrown tens of thousands of petty landlords in the Northwest, burned their deeds, and dispersed their retainers, then if every household, every village in all of China unites, we will have the power to destroy Japanese imperialism—the greatest and most detestable landlord in Asia!"

COX_Stuff_The_Granary_desc: "There is no doubt that an ample food supply is crucial to the outcome of the war. In the last war against Japan, Chinese soldiers and civilians never lacked the courage to face death and the determination to fight to the end. But by completely destroying China's agricultural production, the Japanese army managed to win the war of attrition.\n\nNow, most of the Soviet area has just undergone land reform, and its agricultural foundation is still very fragile. But we have no choice but to urgently requisition the small surplus grain in the hands of the peasants, establishing wartime granaries to supply the needs of frontline combat and rear production.\n\nThe struggle for national freedom allows no hesitation."

The nature of war has undergone profound changes, and even our military commanders—veterans of the last great war—cannot foresee the course of this conflict from their command posts.\n\nTo truly adapt our officers and soldiers to modern warfare, the only way is for them to learn in war and transform on the battlefield.

The enemy we face has transformed. Communists have never been associated with stagnation; only by keeping pace with the times can we ensure our victory without a heavy cost of lives.\n\nHow do we deal with composite armor tanks? How do we destroy low-flying helicopters? How do we counter stronger fortified bunkers?\n\nThe nature of war has undergone dramatic changes.

During the last great war, the Chinese people fully utilized their wisdom, employing every unconventional means to strike at the invaders, engaging in an unyielding struggle—tunnel warfare, landmine warfare, sparrow warfare... Based on the terrain of their homeland and the intensity of the battles, a series of 'traditional methods' tailored to local conditions were created.\n\nIt turns out that these 'traditional methods' are still effective.

While the fervor of resistance ignites the base area, some of our comrades seem to have become overly enthusiastic, which not only failed to improve efficiency but also, to some extent, disrupted the production order. This has caused significant damage to wartime logistics. We will take measures to maintain production order.\n\nFurthermore, we must also pay attention to enemy infiltration. Not everyone is wholeheartedly committed to the national resistance. For some of the defeated reactionaries, the outbreak of war provides them with an opportunity. Many of them are indifferent to the war, seeing it as something happening far away and irrelevant to them. Worse, some might even collude with the Japanese invaders to rebuild their corrupt rule. We must resolutely strike against these national traitors."

COX_Secure_Supply_Lines_desc: "Back in Yan'an, our army's construction was impoverished, and we couldn't even guarantee self-sufficiency in weapons and ammunition. Now we are once again facing an all-out war with the Japanese. This time, our bullets must shoot as far as the Japanese, and our grenades must explode as powerfully as theirs. This requires us to spare no effort in maintaining the smooth operation of our supply lines.\n\nTransporting materials from the factories in the Northwest to the front lines is a difficult journey. The infrastructure built by the Ma family over the years has already been destroyed in the fires of war and chaos. There is no railroad, and the roads passable by trucks are very limited. Many places must rely on human and animal power for transportation. Apart from the harsh natural environment, enemy bombings can still cause significant damage. We will plan feasible routes and mobilize the people in the base areas to ensure the smooth flow of supply lines."

COX_Streamline_Production_Process: "Streamline Production Process"
COX_Streamline_Production_Process_desc: "Yes, when producing supplies, we must ensure quality and quantity, but when facing the heavily armed Japanese, the Red Army soldiers often struggle with insufficient supplies, making it difficult to win or expand the victory. The soldiers need more guns and ammunition, and we need to produce supplies faster to supply the front lines.\n\nOur existing production lines are already very outdated and few in number. Besides continuous production in three shifts, we must introduce simplified production processes to increase output. Fortunately, during the long conflict, the Russian warlords have accumulated extensive experience in 'simplified' production and makeshift weapons."

Although they were once driven to the brink of despair, they survived the most difficult post-war years with the support of the people and their knowledge of the terrain.

COX_emergency_situation_desc: "Our land reform efforts have failed! The reactionary forces have formed a new Xinjiang government in the out-of-control areas, and they are assembling an army to attack us. We must respond immediately!"

COX_assemble_soldiers: "Rally the Rural Soldiers!"
COX_assemble_soldiers_desc: "The enemy threat is imminent. We must gather all our rural soldiers and militia to form combat units, consolidate our remaining territory, and protect the last flame of our revolution."

COX_reinforce_alt_defense: "Strengthen Vigilance!"
COX_reinforce_alt_defense_desc: "We must carry out continuous patrols in the territories we control to prevent the enemy from infiltrating our areas, conducting sabotage, and threatening the safety of the people."

COX_secure_north: "Focus on Northern Security!"
COX_secure_north_desc: "Unlike the southern region of Xinjiang, we still maintain strong control over many areas in the north. We must first stabilize our rule in the north to face the main enemy."

COX_conference_of_alt: "Convene an Emergency Meeting!"
COX_conference_of_alt_desc: "Comrade Mao Anying has resigned as Chairman, leaving the position of the top leader of the Central Committee vacant. Until a new Chairman is elected, the Central Politburo will collectively manage current affairs to address the reactionary rebellion."

COX_we_are_too_weak: "We Are Too Weak!"
COX_we_are_too_weak_desc: "After days of heated debates and discussions, the Central Committee has reached the following conclusion: 'We have been too lenient towards the landlords and reactionary forces, allowing them to exploit the peasants and deceive the government repeatedly. If our military strength is insufficient to decisively defeat the scattered reactionary armed forces across Xinjiang, then we should take this rebellion as an opportunity to annihilate the enemy's reactionary forces once and for all!'"

COX_deal_with_comrade: "Deal with Our Comrades!"
COX_deal_with_comrade_desc: "Fortunately, during our time of chaos, we have Communist comrades around us who can help. We need to seek their assistance."

COX_split_field: "Fight the Landlords, Divide the Land!"
COX_split_field_desc: "Listen! The wails of the serfs in Xinjiang, exploited for thousands of years—how can we abandon our peasant brothers? Under the leadership of our Red Army, we will immediately launch a land distribution campaign and a public ownership movement for water resources, returning the land that belongs to the peasants back to the peasants! Wherever our Red Army goes, we should quickly return all the land of the landlords to the peasants!"

COX_fasten_field_development: "Accelerate the Construction of Farmers' Associations!"
COX_fasten_field_development_desc: "Land distribution alone is not enough; we must quickly promote the construction of farmers' associations. These associations will replace the old gentry organizations, becoming the grassroots political organizations in the countryside, maintaining farmers' rights while continuing class struggle and production activities."

COX_armed_military: "Highly Armed Militia!"
COX_armed_military_desc: "The power of the people is infinite! We Communists must trust the masses! Let's arm our peasant brothers and sisters to protect the land that belongs to them!"

COX_we_are_too_aggressive: "We Are Too Aggressive!"
COX_we_are_too_aggressive_desc: "After days of heated debates and discussions, the Central Committee has reached the following conclusion: 'We overestimated the practical administrative capabilities of the Chinese Communist Party. With the current manpower of the CCP, it is difficult to govern the vast Xinjiang, which spans more than two million square kilometers. Hastily sending valuable cadres to southern Xinjiang has not only led to meaningless casualties but also failed to complete the land revolution, causing the people in landlord-controlled areas to lose trust in us... We are powerless, and can only... make some compromises.'"

COX_armed_military: "Contact Enlightened Gentry"
COX_armed_military_desc: "Throughout history, the landlords in Xinjiang, known as 'Baiye,' have generally held a good reputation among the peasants. These landlords only need to return a small portion of the wealth they have extracted from the peasants by building waterworks, roads, and mosques for the village, and they can become 'good men' and 'messengers of Allah.' We know these landlords are only using the peasants' sweat and blood to promote their own reputation, but what can we do? We can only cooperate with some of the less harsh 'enlightened gentry'..."

COX_acquiescence_squire: "Acquiesce to the Gentry's Rule"
COX_acquiescence_squire_desc: "In most rural areas outside the CCP's sphere of influence, the gentry, not the farmers' associations, are the true rulers of the countryside. The peasants trust the gentry more than they trust the Red Army. Under the gentry's rule, our rural soldiers often 'disappear' or are 'killed in accidents' while carrying out land reform work. We can no longer afford such losses. Perhaps acquiescing to the gentry's rule in areas outside our control is a reasonable choice?"

COX_lease_field_management: "Lenient Land Policy"
COX_lease_field_management_desc: "In areas where land reform has not yet occurred, there will be no land distribution, no rent reduction, and no interest reduction. This is the new land policy currently being implemented. This action is undoubtedly a betrayal of our peasant brothers under the control of reactionary forces... But outside our sphere of influence, our policies of rent and interest reduction often only increase the burden on the peasants, causing them to resent the Communist Party... We have no choice... Our strength is too weak."

COX_enlist_forces: "Incorporate Landlord Forces"
COX_enlist_forces_desc: "Our policies have achieved some success, and some landlords are willing to negotiate with us and cease counter-revolutionary activities. Their armed forces can be reorganized by us to deal with the more stubborn enemies."

COX_eliminate_violence: "Eliminate Violence"
COX_eliminate_violence_desc: "We must stop the current chaos in Xinjiang, end the violence, and return everything to the way it was before..."

COX_all_messed_up: "All in Ruins"
COX_all_messed_up: "Xinjiang is now full of scars left by the chaos, with villages, farmland, and countless families destroyed by the flames of war. We've done our best, but this world is just so cruel..."

#COX_focus.116_desc: "Although we have conquered the Northwest, we cannot govern it effectively due to a severe lack of cadres to manage this vast territory. Moreover, the experiences from Xinjiang may not be applicable in the vast Northwest. We must train more cadres to manage the newly liberated areas according to local conditions. Effect: Grant political points."
#COX_focus.117: "The Red Sun Rises High"
#COX_focus.117_desc: "China once experienced a red revolution, proving that China's revolutionary path differs from the Soviet's urban-centric, quick-win policies. Instead, it is about establishing independent base areas through armed uprisings, gradually building political and economic advantages. Undoubtedly, we should revive these hard-won experiences and align with the past workers' and peasants' Red Army. Effect: Grant national spirit: Northwest's Red Sun: Increase daily political points, improve relations with countries of the same ideology."
#COX_focus.118: "Confront Harsh Reality"
#COX_focus.118_desc: "Ideals cannot be eaten. We must recognize that the current situation is fundamentally different from the first Chinese revolution.

Therefore, we must adapt the experiences of the first Chinese revolution and formulate new policies based on the current revolutionary situation. Effect: Grant national spirit: Black Cat or White Cat: Increase daily political points, improve relations with countries of other ideologies."
#COX_focus.119: "Form Mass Organizations"
#COX_focus.119_desc: "The Party's strength is not solely from the Party itself. In fact, the Party's main power comes from the mass organizations around the Party, such as trade unions, peasant associations, and the Communist Youth League. These mass organizations form the Party's mass base and primary force. Therefore, we must prioritize the development of mass organizations. Effect: Increase local resistance, national spirit: Newly Formed Party Organization changed to Developing Party Organization: Increase daily political points, increase compliance in all regions."
#COX_focus.120: "Confiscate the Wealth of the Exploiting Class"
#COX_focus.120_desc: "Although the Northwest region is extremely backward, there is still a large exploiting class, often in the form of landlords. Even with backward industry, there is a small portion of commercial bourgeoisie. We should confiscate and nationalize the wealth of these exploiting classes and use it for the people, despite many obstacles. Effect: Increase resistance, decrease compliance, grant a factory."
#COX_focus.121: "Expand the Party Organization System"
#COX_focus.121_desc: "Although we have established some mass organizations and united them around the Party, this is not enough. We must further expand our mass base; otherwise, it will be impossible to shake the reactionary forces. Effect: National spirit: Developing Party Organization changed to Expanded Party Organization: Increase daily political points."
#COX_focus.122: "Promote Production Through Revolution"
#COX_focus.122_desc: "Workers have boundless enthusiasm, with diligent hands and a desire for change. But under the dual oppression of capitalism and feudalism, the autonomy of workers is suppressed, and the entire class exhibits a dull, lifeless appearance. Only by breaking the shackles of the capitalist mode of production and arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class can we achieve a full leap in industrial production. Effect: Grant national spirit: Grasp Revolution, Promote Production: Decrease daily political points, increase production efficiency, decrease local compliance."
#COX_focus.123: "Rebuild the Soviet"
#COX_focus.123_desc: "Our Party has been largely rebuilt and has gained a certain mass base in the local area. The Central Committee believes that it is now time to further expand the Party's authority. We have been relying on the military to govern the local area in a warlord-like manner, which is clearly incorrect. We should establish a Soviet institution, elected by the local poor peasants and workers, to greatly enhance our authority in the region. Effect: National spirit: Expanded Party Organization changed to Newly Formed Soviet Government: Increase daily political points, decrease local resistance, increase compliance."
#COX_focus.124: "Workers' Councils"
#COX_focus.124_desc: "It has been proven that the potential of the working class is limitless as long as we can break the shackles of capitalism and ensure that the working masses can control their own destiny. It is clear that our factory management must be handed over to workers' councils composed of advanced workers from the factory itself. No one understands better than the frontline workers where improvement is needed and how to increase production efficiency. Handing over the factory's management to the working class is the best way to improve industrial production efficiency. Effect: Grant political points, national spirit Grasp Revolution, Promote Production changed to Workers' Councils: Increase production efficiency, increase daily political points."
#COX_focus.125: "The People's Government"
#COX_focus.125_desc: "According to Leninism, the Soviet must not be isolated from the actual work by a bureaucracy like in a bourgeois state. The Soviet must be a working system, an organization directly involved in actual work. Therefore, we will expand the various powers of the Soviet, allowing the Soviet institution to directly manage the country. Effect: National spirit Newly Formed Soviet changed to Perfected Soviet: Increase daily political points, increase compliance in regions, decrease local resistance."
#COX_focus.126: "Autonomous Industrial Planning"
#COX_focus.126_desc: "Industrial products are still extremely scarce, but the demand is growing. We must ensure that every penny in our base area is used for revolutionary purposes, benefiting the Red Army. This requires integrating workers' councils from various factories to establish a comprehensive and efficient planning system, ensuring our resources are not wasted. Effect: National spirit Workers' Councils changed to Industrial Planning System: Increase daily political points, increase production efficiency, increase construction efficiency."
#COX_focus.127: "A Degree of Compromise"
#COX_focus.127_desc: "The situation in Xinjiang is extremely complex, with numerous ethnic, religious, and economic conflicts. As a new force that doesn't fit in, it is impossible to maintain effective control of the local area without cooperating with powerful local organizations. Therefore, the first step in establishing ourselves locally is undoubtedly finding local collaborators. Effect: Decrease local resistance."
#COX_focus.128: "Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction"
#COX_focus.128_desc: "As Marx pointed out in 'Capital,' rent is not something naturally generated in the production process but an oppression imposed on it. Increasing rent does not lead to expanded production but rather reduces it. Therefore, both politically and purely in terms of production, rent reduction and interest reduction are absolutely necessary. Effect: Grant political points, increase local compliance."
#COX_focus.129: "Democratic Senate"

#COX_focus.130: "Pluralistic Government"
#COX_focus.130_desc: "Only fascists would rule alone with one party. We cannot ignore the will of the local people. We must allow other parties and forces to participate in our government, whether they are opposition or not. Only a pluralistic government can ensure that the government's policies are accepted by all. Effect: Greatly increase compliance, national spirit Democratic Senate changed to Pluralistic Government Institutions: Decrease daily political points, increase support for other parties monthly."

#COX_focus.131_desc: "We have successfully proven that the Red Army is different from other warlords. The Red Army is not fascist and will not unreasonably persecute dissenters.

Unite all classes, and prepare everything for the fight against Japan. Effect: Grant political points."
#COX_focus.133: "Unified Water Resource Management"
#COX_focus.133_desc: "If we don't manage water resources carefully, even the most basic livelihood issues will arise. Therefore, we must strictly control the use of water resources, concentrating them in the most important and profitable areas.

#COX_focus.134: "Invite Village Elders"
