ultranationalism_qutbism_subtype_desc: "Over a thousand years ago, the people of the Arabian Peninsula were immersed in ignorance and immorality: they worshiped man-made idols, drowned newborn girls in water, and the entire society from top to bottom was filled with bloodshed and deceit. However, a righteous man emerged from among the tribes, guided by Allah, to deliver the message of humility and obedience to them. The once weak, poor, and internally conflicted Arabs soon united under the guidance of Islamic faith, overcoming all enemies that threatened them, and created a golden age of cultural and scientific prosperity.\n\nHowever, to Sayyid Qutb and his followers, that prosperous and glorious era has long turned into a few dry ink marks in dusty history books. When stripping away the facade of faith and justice, all that remains is endless ignorance and decay. The heart of the Islamic world, which once shone so brightly, has long stopped beating, and the once vast empire spanning Eurasia has degenerated into numerous man-made states that submit to foreign imperialists. The incompetent and immoral rulers cheer for the atrocities of Western colonizers, ignore the suffering of their own people, allow evil and depravity to spread throughout society, and crime has become a necessary means of survival in such a world.\n\nFor Qutbists, the solution to the dangers facing the Muslim world does not lie in the worship of flashy foreign nationalist ideologies or in the complex and tedious dichotomy of classes, but only in returning to the words of Allah and the Prophet. Only by organizing a vanguard of a few faithful believers, cleansing the material world of its sweet temptations, and reestablishing Allah's rule on earth, can ignorance and deceit be eradicated from every crevice of society. Only in this way can the Ummah return to that era of unity and prosperity and create a new world without imperialist colonizers and depraved desires—a world where everyone is indifferent to the hollow material and focuses only on their rank in paradise alongside their fellow believers."

UTL_Mustafa_Shokay:"Mustafa Shokay"
UTL_Mustafa_Shokay_desc:"In 1890, Mustafa Shokay was born into a wealthy and prestigious noble family on the Kazakh steppe. Descended from the Kerei and Janibek bloodlines, he showed extraordinary talent from a young age and later pursued further studies at the Faculty of Law in St. Petersburg. Mustafa Shokay's future seemed destined to be as bright and dazzling as the sun over the steppe. However, with the sound of a gunshot in Sarajevo, everything vanished. The Tsarist government soon collapsed amid internal and external troubles, and the red tide swept over every inch of land under the banner of the double-headed eagle, including his homeland. At that time, he was discussing the autonomy of Turkestan with his colleagues, seeking the right for the Central Asian people to decide their own fate, but the only response was the bayonets and bullets of the Bolsheviks. Mustafa Shokay thus embarked on a journey of exile, eventually settling in Paris, where he would remain for twenty years.\n\nIn 1941, the Nazi war machine swept through Eastern Europe, and all prominent émigrés born on Soviet soil were arrested by the occupying forces, Shokay included. However, just a few weeks later, the Nazis proposed that he lead the 'Turkestan Legion'—a unit composed of émigrés and prisoners of war to fight against the Soviet Union for the freedom of Turkestan. With the recommendation of Alfred Rosenberg, Minister for the Eastern Occupied Territories, Shokay donned the black uniform and led the legion to witness the destruction of the red giant, but the Germans did not fulfill their promises. From that point on, the legion's soldiers were occupied with suppressing bandits and guerrillas, only finding moments of respite on the banks of the Volga, gazing at the vast steppe across the border.\n\nTen years later, events took another turn. The West Russian Revolutionary Front launched a do-or-die battle, and the Turkestan Legion was once again thrown into the fight against the Bolsheviks. But one snowy night, the legion soldiers huddled in the frontline command post suddenly discovered that a unit of SS soldiers, bearing grenade insignias, had launched an attack on them. Mustafa Shokay smelled danger—he knew the Germans were finally going to turn on him. The Turkestan Legion quickly disengaged from the battle, trekking through the chaos of the Caucasus to the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran. However, the Shah, unwilling to damage his relationship with his German allies, packed the legion into a train bound for the East—to Afghanistan. There, Mustafa Shokay received an opportunity—a long-awaited chance to return to his homeland.\n\nThis is the excuse Mustafa Shokay used to ease his guilt. Everyone knows that the 'Turkestan Legion' is nothing more than a group of well-trained bandits, and he himself is nothing more than a cowardly opportunist, but Shokay himself doesn't care. However, in a certain office with closed doors and windows, the map of Central Asia on the desk, pinned with legion flags, is already soaked with tears."

UZB_START_desc: "As the saying goes, 'Blessings in disguise.' Although this is a Chinese proverb, Sharaf Rashidovich Rashidov is perhaps one of the few in the world who truly understands its meaning.\n\nOn October 24, 1917, on the eve of the cannon fire on the Neva River, Sharaf Rashidovich Rashidov was born into an ordinary farming family in Jizzakh. On June 21, 1941, Rashidov graduated from Samarkand State University; before he could recover from his expectations and reluctance, he found himself holding a rifle on the front lines of the Great Patriotic War. His bravery and achievements earned him the Order of the Red Star and a serious injury. In 1943, as Rashidov recovered in a hospital in Uzbekistan, preparing to return to the front, the bad news came from Moscow—they had lost.\n\nThe national disaster brought many to their knees, but not Rashidov. In 1948, Rashidov successfully graduated from the Party School in Tashkent and was then assigned by the central government to Samarkand. Many of his friends were outraged by this—how could the Soviet Union throw aside a hero who had shed his blood for her? But the always optimistic and easygoing Rashidov quietly accepted it, and soon after, Tashkent experienced a leadership purge involving the Tyumen regime. As a Communist, Rashidov did not believe in predestination, but he felt he was destined to bear a heavier burden than others.\n\nThis was indeed the case. Although he did not make it to the capital, the capital soon came to him. Ferghana, the powder keg of Central Asia, exploded, and the leadership in Tashkent fled in haste, leaving behind ruins, ashes, and people. With the independence of Nukus and the invasion of the Legion, the disgraced old cadres were soon ousted from power by angry Party members. As the local Party representative, Sharaf Rashidovich Rashidov took over this country that was on the brink of disaster, with all its borders lost.\n\nRashidov did not bring about any substantial change to Uzbekistan; rather, his efforts prevented the land from falling into even greater disaster. He failed to reclaim the southern land occupied by Nazi bandits, but the defensive battle he commanded deterred them from advancing on Bukhara and Samarkand. He also failed to eliminate the armed groups rampaging through the countryside, but his methods managed to make some of them loyal to him or cooperate with him. He also failed to restore communication with Tashkent, but always found a way to channel more supplies into this isolated city.\n\nMany Party members quietly spoke of him with a tone of sympathy, believing that in a better world, Rashidov would have brought unprecedented prosperity and glory to Uzbekistan. But Rashidov himself always felt that it would have been the greatest fortune to heroically die in the defense of Moscow rather than witness the fall of his homeland into chaos."

TAJ_START: "Jabbor Rasulovich Rasulov"
TAJ_START_desc: "Agriculture may be the closest invention humanity has created to the essence of life: two species as different as night and day become intertwined by some accidental coincidence, ensuring each other's survival and continuation in a cycle of consumption and being consumed, eventually becoming inseparable. When the cycle breaks down, civilization vanishes; this is the tragedy Jabbor Rasulovich Rasulov is witnessing.\n\nJabbor Rasulovich Rasulov was born in 1913. Unlike many who rose to high positions within the Soviet political system, he was a technocrat from the beginning to the end. In 1934, shortly after graduating from the Central Asian Cotton Irrigation Institute, he was sent to the southern Tajikistan, the barren and undeveloped Vakhsh River Valley, to oversee the development of the cotton industry. With the support of the central government and his personal efforts, the Vakhsh River Valley quickly became the second-largest grain and cotton production area in the republic, second only to Ferghana, saving many lives on this land twenty years later. This achievement earned him a promotion to Minister of Agriculture of Tajikistan, and there were even rumors that the Kremlin was preparing to promote him to the central government to manage agriculture across the entire union.\n\nLike many, his career was interrupted by the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War. The front was advancing closer to Moscow every day, and every day Moscow was desperately demanding more resources to sustain itself, almost draining the life out of the Central Asian land. Rasulov understood that in times of crisis, everyone must make necessary sacrifices, but he could not allow the Tajik people to starve. Therefore, he focused his energy on meticulous planning, which earned him respect but also placed him in an unenviable position in the future.\n\nAn ancient Greek sage once said, 'If you avoid politics, politics will come to you.' The collapse of the Soviet Union and the efforts of the Tyumen regime to unify Central Asia brought unprecedented shock to this technocrat who had never touched ideology. The Tajik leadership, in their rush to embrace Stalinist ideology, desperately sought a scapegoat to bear the sins of the Bukharin era, and Rasulov, with his shallow political power, became the soft target, demoted back to Vakhsh to continue being an agronomist. But changing policies on a whim is never a good idea, and the cadres who followed Tyumen's example soon made a mess of agricultural production in Khujand, leading to two major blows: the Ferghana crisis and Afghanistan's opportunistic invasion. With half of the country lost and the leadership losing the people's support, Rasulov was reluctantly elevated to the position of chairman.\n\nIn the face of the country's hopeless situation, Rasulov is only filled with confusion. Sometimes, the staff knocking on his office door can only see an empty desk, while cotton farmers in the countryside inadvertently catch a glimpse of that familiar face in the corner of their eyes."

KRK_START1_desc: "What is the most painful thing in life? Is it striving your whole life for something that remains out of reach, or achieving perfection through hard work only to find what you have gained is something you despise?\n\nAmet Shamuratov was born in 1912 in a poor peasant family in Khojeili. He held various positions as a young man, including primary school teacher, district inspector, and local Soviet secretary, but at the age of 24, he finally discovered that artistic creation was the field where his talents could be fully utilized. He could write imaginative and exciting adventure stories for children and could also praise the diligence and wisdom of the people. When the destruction and death of war finally spread to the Soviet Union, he was already the vice-chairman of the Karakalpak Soviet. Neither his official position nor the war could dampen Shamuratov's enthusiasm for creation; he turned to singing praises of the people's labor and struggle during the difficult years of war and took great pride in it.\n\nBut the world is material, and songs of praise cannot stop the tracks and boots of the Nazi Empire. The homeland he never spared ink and effort to praise collapsed before him, and the years of war had drained this land of its resources and young blood, leaving everyone unable to accept such a result. But life goes on, and Amet Shamuratov continues to create, encouraging the people to emerge from the shadow of failure and adapt to this unfamiliar new world.\n\nHowever, this new world did not spare this land and its people, nor did it spare him. As the flames of war in West Russia rekindled and extinguished, people could no longer hold back. The representatives of the Nukus Soviet, knowing they could not withstand the people's anger, anxiously declared the independence of the Karakalpak Republic from the Soviet Union and Uzbekistan. Unsurprisingly, Amet Shamuratov was elected president due to his reputation and oratory skills.\n\nMidnight revelries may bring joy, but the arrival of dawn with a hangover is another matter. Changing the national flag and name cannot fill the stomachs of the hungry, and the old cadres are unable to support a functioning state apparatus; seizing Khwarazm in the chaos may be the decision he regrets the most in his life, and the close relationship with Kazakhstan cannot withstand the test of time. The writer finally threw his pen aside, letting it crash onto the floor, splattering ink everywhere. An unfinished work still lies in the bookcase, and he doubts he will have the opportunity to complete it in his lifetime.\n\nWhat is the most painful thing in life? Is it striving your whole life for something that remains out of reach, or achieving perfection through hard work only to find what you have gained is something you despise? For Amet Shamuratov, he is currently experiencing both forms of pain simultaneously."

TRK_START: "Balysh Ovizoovich Ovizov"
TRK_START_desc: "Since ancient times, Turkmenistan has been a desolate and overlooked land, neither as fertile as the northern delta and the magnificent Yulduziji City nor as coveted by conquerors as Khorasan to the south. Only the clay and rubble of the ruins of Merv remain to remind people of this land's past and its ever-unchanging future. And in Balysh Ovizoovich Ovizov's eyes, now is no different from the past.\n\nBalysh Ovizoovich Ovizov was born in 1915 in a small village in the southwestern corner of the Khwarezm oasis. He spent the first half of his life climbing the political ladder, moving steadily upwards, ultimately graduating from the Party School of the Soviet Central Committee in the year of the Great Patriotic War's defeat. However, the longer he stayed in the political arena and the higher his rank, the more he realized that neither he nor the entire Soviet Union had brought any fundamental change to Turkmenistan. Bukharin was unwilling to alter the traditional lifestyle of the vast countryside, and despite Soviet rule lasting for a generation, many people in his homeland still lived the same lives as they did centuries ago: searching for water and pastures, herding sheep and camels, or harvesting crops in the summer and autumn and then moving their tents to the oasis to spend the winter with their tribes. The efforts to cultivate a national identity also failed; instead of identifying themselves as Turkmen, the people of this land preferred to define themselves by their tribes and then bicker over them. But at least, while holding a party position in Ashgabat, Ovizov could forget these things, basking in the faint light of modernity and socialism, to the point of forgetting that this light source had long since dimmed.\n\nThen the Ashgabat earthquake shattered everything. Although Ovizov was pulled out in time by rescuers, his soul—and Turkmenistan's soul—had long since dispersed into the ruins, to the point of forgetting when he even sat in this position. The unruly tribal chiefs ruled the countryside; perhaps the innate characteristics of the nomads made them unwilling to submit to anything other than power and wealth. Turkmen mercenaries once fought valiantly under Ottoman and Safavid banners, and they established great dynasties like the Seljuks and Afshars, but they could not unite under their own national flag. Ovizov always knew they were the true rulers of Turkmenistan, and he was nothing more than a tomb keeper for the ruins of Ashgabat.\n\nPerhaps, a hundred years later, when travelers from distant lands visit this place, the skeletal steel, scattered bricks, and broken concrete slabs will remind them that the past and future of this land remain unchanged."

KYR_START_desc: "Speaking is an instinct, saying the right thing is a virtue, but knowing when to say the right thing is a one-in-a-million skill.\n\nTurdakun Usubaliev was born in 1919, and his career began as the principal of a school in his hometown village. Soon, students and teachers noticed that unlike the usual long-winded sermons full of empty rhetoric, his speeches were always short but had a cohesive force. This ability quickly gained the appreciation of his superiors, and Usubaliev joined the Department of Agitation and Propaganda. After the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, his articles and speeches greatly calmed the public, with some even believing that it was he, rather than Moscow or Frunze, who maintained the stability of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Stalinist regime of Tyumen and the Soviet regimes in Central Asia established contact. At this time, all Central Asian countries were trying to shake off the shadows of the past, and the new ideological concepts brought by Stalin provided them with an opportunity. As Uzbekistan officially made an ideological shift, the leadership in Frunze also became restless. At this time, Usubaliev, always regarded as the mouthpiece of the Soviet Union, suddenly mobilized the propaganda machine to criticize and question the Tyumen regime. The decision to shift ideology quickly sparked a debate among the leadership and was ultimately left unresolved. Usubaliev took this opportunity to maneuver within the Party, even gaining a position in the Frunze Soviet.\n\nBut soon, the negative consequences of rashly shifting policies began to emerge. Uzbekistan and Tajikistan's interference in local affairs triggered an unprecedented central-local conflict, leading to the Ferghana Crisis. While Frunze was at a loss, Usubaliev once again took action. For a time, it seemed that the entire nation was demanding the leadership take strong measures to ensure the safety of Ferghana.\n\nWith Kyrgyz security forces entering and taking control of Andijan, Khujand, Kokand, and Gulistan, Usubaliev's reputation soared, and he naturally took the position of leader of Kyrgyzstan. Previously vehemently opposed to the ideological shift, his first move upon taking office was to rename the Party, removing the 'inappropriate' elements of Bolshevism, and recasting the new Kyrgyzstan as the legitimate successor of the Turkestan Autonomous Government.\n\nIn the eyes of the Kyrgyz people, Usubaliev is a great leader, reformer, and national hero who firmly ensured the stability of Kyrgyzstan and the surrounding regions in the post-Soviet era. But this is neither fact nor lie. Turdakun Usubaliev not only knows when to say the right thing but also knows that a lie does not equal the incorrect. However, some would disagree with this view."

In just a few seconds, the clay and adobe that made up this city were all destroyed, replaced by a layer of horrifying white dust that covered the sky and the sun.'\n\nThe Ashgabat earthquake, which occurred on the morning of October 6, 1948, completely destroyed Turkmenistan's national machinery and hope. Even though more than a decade has passed since that disaster, the reconstruction work is still far from complete, and in fact, it is gradually coming to a halt. The aid from the Tyumen regime is limited by its scale and distance, and even if it is not a drop in the bucket, it cannot restore the city to its former state. The deceitful tricks played by Iran have not advanced the reconstruction process much; instead, Turkmenistan has lost large tracts of land along the Caspian Sea. Many citizens of Ashgabat still live in shabby metal sheds or even tents. As for water and electricity supply? Pray for rain; trust me, that method is far more reliable."

A generation of Soviet rule is far from sufficient to dissolve Turkmenistan's tribal traditions, which are now flourishing even more. The major tribes have essentially become independent kingdoms, engaging in trade, diplomacy, and warfare with each other. Some tribes have even established informal relations with other countries, sending some young men to serve as 'volunteers' to dig trenches for them...

If you can still eat well, dress warmly, and sleep in your own room without these things, then few would be attracted to them.\n\nBut when people perceive their lives to be a mess, they seek change. Trucks heading to Tashkent, Moscow, the front lines, Ashgabat, and the front lines again take away grain, cotton, livestock, and soldiers—whatever they transport is draining the life out of this land. So, the idea of change becomes a hope, then an obsession, and finally a desire. This desire burns so fiercely that when everything finally collapses, it breaks through human hearts and materializes into reality, tearing a new scar across Central Asia under the dim sun, a rose blooming on the remains of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Samarkand regime has long been powerless to handle border affairs, and Almaty has extended an olive branch.

Of course, all this is likely to happen only after Nukus has lost the protection of Almaty.\n\nKazakh and Karakalpak cultures are similar, so since the day of independence, Almaty has become Nukus' patron. But this mountain is not reliable, and it may even collapse while being relied upon. Kazakhstan's situation is not much better than that of its neighbors, and it is very likely to experience the same pain that the four Central Asian countries went through in the 1950s, but humanity never learns from history, and it is doubtful that Nukus' diplomats have studied history either."

Kyrgyzstan is this dazzling sun in the sea of sand.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, Kyrgyzstan's level of industrialization and urbanization was the highest among the four Central Asian countries, with its people enjoying more prosperity, progress, and modernization every day than the day before. Even though the other three countries were teetering on the brink of disaster due to natural disasters, human unrest, and external enemies, Kyrgyzstan fortunately did not experience any severe shocks. In fact, it decisively dispatched troops to Fergana as the situation there gradually heated up, occupying and securing the area, ensuring peace and stability, while also opening up transportation routes between northern and southern Kyrgyzstan.\n\nIn the face of the Soviet Union's collapse, no one could remain unscathed. Kyrgyzstan, too, was troubled by the times, but when all the others on the track are retreating, the one standing still can easily become the champion. Even if the title holds little meaning, it's not a bad thing to comfort oneself with it, right?"
KYR_winner_but_bandit:"Winner but Bandit"
KYR_winner_but_bandit_desc:"Things are always delicate in the East. In theory, Kyrgyzstan's stability and prosperity in this forsaken and corrupt corner of Central Asia should be worthy of its reputation as a fertile oasis, although 'stability' means that bandits are rarely seen, and 'prosperity' means that the supply of food and fuel is more sufficient and stable, but it is enough to make others envious.\n\nBut this prosperity has not earned Kyrgyzstan any good reputation; instead, it has made other countries keep their distance. Those with more wealth and fame always attract admiration, but what if others knew how they attained such status?\n\nNo one praises the warmth and brightness of the sun in the desert. In the struggle, it severed the arms of its former neighbors, seized their fields, and claimed enough wealth to fill its belly... The turbulent times leave no room for mercy, but aggression still breeds resentment. The bloodshot eyes staring directly at the sun have never retreated before its blinding light. Never take what was given to you as your own, for the day of reckoning is certain."
KYR_a_nation_divided_into_three:"A Nation Divided into Three"
KYR_a_nation_divided_into_three_desc:"Any country with enough land to divide its residents into two or more groups will face regional conflicts. Kyrgyzstan is a prime example of this: the northern Chuy Valley is flat and rich in water resources, historically regarded by both the Tsar and the Soviets as an industrial center. The roar of machinery and the network of water facilities transformed this land and its people, who proudly entered the 'modern life' of Russian culture; the Kyrgyz part of the southern Fergana Valley, although small in area, has conditions that make it the granary and orchard of Kyrgyzstan, with its residents more likely to adhere to the old ways and live their lives as their parents and grandparents did.\n\nIf the conflict between these two regions is just a matter of urban-rural and agrarian-industrial tension that most countries face, what happens when you add in the recently 'taken over' Fergana? Perhaps the Uzbek and Tajik residents do not care much about the emblem on their ID cards, but the batons of the Kyrgyz police and the favoritism of the local administration toward their kin make it impossible for them to remain calm.\n\nThus, Kyrgyzstan is divided into three worlds, with each world viewing the others as degenerates, barbarians, and oppressors. Although the level of mutual hatred is not enough to trigger a civil war, it is still not an issue to be ignored."

LFB_DDS_news.1.d:"Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Central Asia has become a forsaken land, with few paying attention to the events unfolding here. But earlier today, news came from the ancient city of Samarkand that the Uzbek government has declared they will 'deal harshly with the Khwarazm issue.'\n\nThe Karakalpakstan Republic declared its independence from the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic amid the chaos of the 1950s, proclaiming itself the successor of the Khiva Khanate and the Khwarazm Soviet, and, with the support of the Kazakh government, seized control of the Khwarazm region. But now, the government in Almaty is overwhelmed by internal problems. Surrounded on all sides, the Uzbek people, eager to restore their honor, have chosen to seize this opportunity to reclaim the fertile Amu Darya delta. Border skirmishes have already resulted in several casualties, and it is hard to predict how this incident will end."

LFB_DDS_news.2.d:"At 5 a.m. on April 26, 1966, the former capital of Uzbekistan, Tashkent, experienced its first earthquake in nearly a century. With most Soviet-era monitoring facilities no longer operational, the Afghan Seismological Institute could only roughly estimate the intensity and epicenter of the earthquake. It is said that the earthquake had a magnitude of only around 5.2, and although the epicenter was very shallow and near the city center, the earthquake consisted mostly of P-waves rather than S-waves, so the destruction was not severe, though it still caused incalculable damage.\n\nMost of the houses in the old city were severely damaged, and even many of the buildings constructed during the Soviet era have become dangerous. Fortunately, the number of casualties 'remains within acceptable limits.' However, the situation is grim. Currently, up to 200,000 people in Tashkent are homeless, and the destruction of infrastructure by the earthquake, along with the long-standing Kyrgyz blockade, has severely hindered the transportation of personnel and supplies. A few researchers who have been closely following the situation in Central Asia for a long time claim that this disaster may lead to a repeat of the Ferghana Crisis of the 1950s."

LFB_DDS_news.3.d:"In the 1930s, the Soviet policy of national identification led to the fertile Ferghana Valley being divided among the three neighboring republics. But with the collapse of the West Siberian Republic in the 1950s and the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet regimes in Central Asia, conflicts over water resources and the power vacuum in the border areas sparked the First Ferghana Crisis. The weakness and helplessness of the Uzbek and Tajik governments led the Kyrgyz leadership to decisively deploy troops to forcibly take control of the entire Ferghana region, even surrounding Tashkent, cutting it off from the rest of Uzbekistan.\n\nHowever, this brief respite was not to last. Due to the Tashkent earthquake and the series of secondary disasters and subsequent issues it brought, Ferghana once again erupted in conflict. It is reported that Kyrgyz security forces have lost control of Andijan, and disaster victims in Tashkent have launched either spontaneous or organized resistance, capturing several 'checkpoints' on the city's outskirts.\n\nThe situation in Bishkek has become increasingly dire. But from another perspective, this crisis also presents an opportunity for Central Asian countries to sit down at the negotiating table and resolve the lingering issues left by the Soviet Union once and for all."

However, as the activities of the local resistance movement 'Badakhshan Ruby' intensified, the Afghan army paid a heavy price in this sparsely populated and resource-poor region, with hundreds of lives lost and countless injured. Over time, the Afghan public became increasingly unwilling to see their family and friends bleed for this barren land, let alone the impact on Afghanistan's relationship with its greatest ally due to the death of several Japanese military advisors.\n\nMeanwhile, 'Badakhshan Ruby' is actively negotiating a transfer of power with Bukharinabad."

It is reported that both sides have used lethal weapons, including rifles and Molotov cocktails, and several villages have been burned, dozens of people killed in violent clashes, hundreds injured, and more fleeing their homes.\n\nIt is said that this incident originated from a traffic accident involving a Dungan driver, but now the cause is irrelevant. Kazakh youths and nationalists are flocking to the Chuy River Valley, and the small and isolated Dungan communities are powerless to resist. Additionally, there are reports that Kazakh nationalists have begun 'cleansing' other minority groups, including Tatars, Koreans, and Uighurs. With most Kazakh security forces still busy dealing with the aftermath of the Kazakh-Russian conflict in the north, this conflict seems destined to escalate into a large-scale massacre of minority groups."

Meanwhile, a small number of refugees, primarily Uighurs and Koreans, have chosen to trek to the Ili River Valley, hoping for protection from the communist regime in Urumqi.\n\nKazakh nationalist mobs continue to rampage unchecked in the Chuy River Valley, and every day, hundreds of refugees cross the border, seeking shelter, further destabilizing the already fragile situation in Kyrgyzstan. While Kyrgyz border departments are doing their best to arrange supplies and accommodation for the refugees, some are concerned that neighboring regimes will use this opportunity to consolidate their influence in the region."

The people have endured the ruins for over twenty years, and now they can finally return to normal life.\n\nSince Ashgabat was severely damaged in the 1948 earthquake, the city has never recovered, and reconstruction efforts were stalled for various reasons. But now, Ashgabat has resumed normal transportation and municipal services, with basic lighting, water supply, and garbage disposal covering the entire city, and the 'temporary' tent shelters for disaster victims have been mostly dismantled.

Because today, several countries in the region, led by Uzbekistan, announced the formation of a military alliance to eliminate the 'Turkestan Legion,' a warlord group occupying southern Uzbekistan with Afghan support, and to finally rid themselves of the shadows of the 1950s.\n\nAlthough the Afghan Kingdom has been secretly supplying the legion with materials and weapons since the moment they began their 'northern expedition,' even sending political prisoners of Turkic descent to serve as forced soldiers, Kabul has remained silent on the matter. Some analysts point to the painful memories of Mountain-Badakhshan as the reason Afghanistan dares not directly intervene in Central Asian affairs again, while others believe the rise of political opposition within Afghanistan leaves it too preoccupied to focus on regional geopolitics. In any case, the high-spirited Central Asian coalition is now firmly advancing southward, vowing to plant their flags on the northern bank of the Amu Darya."

There are rumors that the party has been secretly organizing militias within the city, distributing leaflets and weapons to the angry masses.\n\nNeighboring countries have all expressed concern over the current situation, fearing that this event could become the spark for the Islamic Liberation Party to launch an open armed rebellion in Central Asia.

The newly formed 'Tajik United Opposition' declared their intention to overthrow the corrupt and incompetent Bukharinabad government and fight for bread, land, and freedom for the Tajik people. Some sources claim that the Afghan government is secretly aiding them.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Islamic Liberation Party militias stationed in Khujand in the north have seized this opportunity to march south, putting the Tajik government in a two-front predicament.

Qin Tonghui, director of the Local Work Department of the Political Security Office, asked the accompanying local militia cadre.\n'Yes, we noticed it the first time we engaged them last week. These bastards' marksmanship is no worse than ours; we barely managed to push them back, losing several comrades in the process. They even cover each other during retreats. Last night, we raided their stronghold but only caught one prisoner, and we got nothing out of him after a whole night of interrogation.'\n'He refused to talk? He must be one tough nut to crack...'\n'No, no, he started talking early on.' The militia cadre hastily interrupted. 'The problem is, no one here could understand what he was saying. We brought in the village's old mullah, but he could only tell that the guy was speaking Arabic, but he's quite old.'\nQin Tonghui hadn't even started to ponder further when the makeshift adobe house used for temporary detention appeared before him. The two unlocked the door and went inside, seeing a man tied to a broken chair with thick ropes, his nose absurdly high, his beard so thick you couldn't see his mouth. Although his body showed no signs of injury or blood, his face was ashen as if he hadn't slept all night.\nQin Tonghui strode over, grabbed the man's collar, and racked his brain for the Arabic he had learned in the Soviet Union in his youth: 'liman taemala,' meaning something like 'who do you work for,' he thought, though not very confidently.\nThe man's expression visibly changed for a moment, then he calmly and wearily uttered two words as if a musician had finally found a cow that appreciated music: 'hizb ut-tahrir...'\n'If I remember correctly, 'hizb' means party, right?' The militia cadre mused, as a flash of realization passed through his thoughts, causing him to instinctively meet Qin Tonghui's gaze.\n 'The situation is serious; I need to report this to the central authorities.

As long as we make it back to the commander alive and in one piece, he'll let this slide. You need to balance principle with flexibility.'\nSeeing his comrade sitting in silence, Nursawti didn't push further, but his restless mind soon fixated on a stack of old newspapers in the corner.\n'These guys were quite thoughtful, leaving us something to pass the time. I just wonder if there are any sexy girls in there. I heard that Shah is quite liberal in this area, a feudal monarch indulging in the corrupt practices of capitalism...' Nursawti flipped through the pages with interest, even though he couldn't read the Dari and Pashto text. Having something is better than nothing.\nAt some point, Nursawti felt he had seen something on one of the previous pages, something that made his eyes sting with familiarity. Some curiosity drove him to flip back through the pages one by one. Maybe he was just seeing things, maybe it was just a satirical cartoon by an Afghan artist, he tried to convince himself. But the result left him frozen in place.\n'Why aren't you reading further? Did the sexy girls steal your soul?'
