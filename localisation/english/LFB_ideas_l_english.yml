  wandering: "The Wanderer's Return"
  wandering_desc: "§RThe bones by the river, pitiful, are still the dreamers in a wanderer's dream§!. There is no doubt that the soldiers of the 88th Guards Infantry Brigade are steadfast communists. They fought on Russian soil for the liberation of workers and peasants and to uphold the torch of communism. Their hot blood was left in the cold and bitter land of Siberia. But their longing for home never faded. An isolated army, embarking on a journey of thousands of miles to return home—this is undoubtedly a journey of certain death, yet they set out anyway.\n\nUnder the bright sun on the land of China, all beings are in misery. Don't come back! This is no longer home! In a vague sense, someone seems to shout in the ears of these wanderers.\n\nYes, the homeland they once knew no longer exists. Under the dark reactionary rule, the hometown they longed for in their memories has long vanished, and those dear to them have turned into one among the countless dry bones by the roadside, becoming fertilizer for the wealthy in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nBut the wanderers are steadfast communists, they must lift the torch and find a way to illuminate their homeland, which has sunk into darkness.\n\n§GIf there is no torchlight after this, we must become the sparks to awaken the sleeping fire of the prairie and drive away the darkness.§!"
  low_support: "The Flame is Dying"
  low_support_desc: "For the people of Xinjiang, and indeed for all Chinese people, what is communism, and what can it bring? We once had a chance to prove all this to them, but now, it's too late. Interest in politics is rapidly waning among the masses, and people would rather waste their lives under the oppression of the autocratic government than raise their heads and dare to dream boldly. Perhaps, in the hearts of many, we are just another warlord force waving a strange red flag.\n\nIn our hands is the last possibility of reigniting the revolutionary flame: the remaining enthusiasm of the masses cannot tolerate the slightest mistake. We must present them with a satisfactory blueprint—§xthere will be no next chance§!."

  comrade_friendship_desc: "Communism is the doctrine of the liberation of the proletariat, and this proletariat is not limited to a region or certain individuals, but encompasses the oppressed worldwide. From the slave laborers in Nazi Germany's dark factories, to the struggling farmers on the Russian wastelands, to the serfs in Xinjiang, and even to the migrant workers whose land was seized and who were sent to factories in Japanese-occupied territories, or the workers in South America's sweatshops, fueling the state machinery—all these oppressed are the objects of communism's liberation.\n\nThe Red Army is the army of all the oppressed. The Red Armies of various countries are comrades, sharing a common class foundation. We will help each other, complementing each other's shortcomings, standing by each other to aid those §Gforgotten laborers§!"

#National spirits during the early stage of land reform in Xinjiang
  chaotic_band: "Fragmented Border"
  chaotic_band_desc: "The Sheng Shicai regime never 'overly' concerned itself with Xinjiang's border areas, especially when trade with the Soviet Union plummeted after its collapse, and the cost of maintaining border stability skyrocketed. Sheng Shicai decisively abandoned the defense of the northwest border, turning instead to integrate Xinjiang into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. With the rallying cry of 'Northwest Rise', Dihua reaped many benefits as well. However, the trade routes through the mountains and valleys bred numerous bandits and outlaws who lived by looting, robbing, and collecting 'tolls'. To this day, these outlaws have become a threat to the eastern border..."

  yananmoshi: "Yan'an Model"
  yananmoshi_desc: "The revolutionary situation in Xinjiang is exceptionally perilous, and many problems are ones we are encountering for the first time. For this reason, the independent and self-reliant Yan'an spirit, which relies on the masses, is particularly important. Our cadres will use practical methods to investigate the land situation in each village in order to carry out larger-scale mass movements—just like the one that took place in northern Shaanxi twenty years ago."

XPC_China_shengchanjianshebingtuan_desc: "‘The Oasis of the Western Regions’, ‘Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall’, the Ili River Valley is known by such names, and its western section is no exception. However, since 1864, this is no longer the northwest, but ‘Outer’ Northwest.\n\nIn 1935, Stalin and his group proposed establishing an autonomous region for the Uyghurs in Kazakhstan, to implement Lenin's proposal for national self-determination. However, this was rejected by Bukharin, and the Kazakh Soviet was allowed to proceed with the ‘Kazakhization’ process. Now, the Uyghurs who huddle together in the western section of the Ili River Valley are the victims and resisters of the Kazakhization process. They survive in the power vacuum between Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, causing considerable trouble for the Kazakhs. Unlike the Russians in the north, the Uyghurs have sought external support, aiming to join the Soviet region, and they have indeed achieved this.\n\nOur reclamation teams are helping the refugees here to develop the economy. Fortunately, this is not the Gobi Desert; the western section of the Ili River Valley has many areas that can be developed. We have assigned this task to our Production and Construction Corps. The Kazakhs have not resented us for this, and have even agreed to trade with us. After all, for them, occupying the western section of the Ili River Valley holds no meaning. We hope to establish a model of §Yethnic unity and cooperation§! in the western section of the Ili River Valley…"
XPC_China_zhongyangyuanzhu: "Central Funding"
XPC_China_zhongyangyuanzhu_desc: "Our reclamation team has arrived in this area. It is not a desolate landscape of endless yellow sand, but we still call it ‘wasteland’. After all, an area that cannot be utilized is as good as a wasteland. However, relying solely on our self-reliance here, it is impossible to complete the task. The army needs wages, and the people need even more.\n\nFortunately, we can now receive support from §Vthe Xinjiang Soviet Region§!. They will provide us with food, drink, and shelter, and will also fund our efforts to develop this area. The hard days for the people here are coming to an end, but happiness still requires us to fight together under the same sky."

But in the hearts of the Northwest people, these men from Lanzhou are not like Ma Jiyuan, who skinned and flayed people alive! Active on the frontlines of resistance against Japan, they fought bravely and repeatedly thwarted Japanese attempts to advance westward, and were the first to raise the flag of rebellion against Ma Jiyuan's corrupt rule. Although Ma Dunsheng believes he is the culprit leading Qinghai into chaos, many in Qinghai see him as the rightful ruler—although Ningma lacks the personnel and experience to manage this territory.\n\nFortunately, in order to reclaim their homeland, Ningma §Rtemporarily§! agrees to cooperate with the Communist Party…"

Ma's scorched earth policy and the frequent sweeps by the Japanese turned the area between Xining and Lanzhou into a barren wasteland. With the revival of the ‘conscription system’, a large number of able-bodied men were pressed into service as soldiers. Under the exploitation of officers at all levels, many of these young men, suffering from hunger and cold, perished on the way to Xining. Ma's collapse ushered in an even more chaotic era, where everyone seized land to rule, villages formed alliances for self-defense, and refugees were displaced. The once flourishing Northwest, ten years ago, has become nothing more than a fleeting dream…"

Even so, to ensure the stability of the eastern border, the Party has spared no effort in providing aid to Qinghai. The 'Northwest Bureau', composed of cadres with extensive political work experience and several key central Party members, is the core of the Communist Party's fragile control in Qinghai and is granted significant autonomy. These cadres' rich work experience ensures that the most favorable strategies for the revolution are formulated in the face of insufficient resources, numerous enemies, and difficulties in carrying out the land reform."

  SHX_idea_1: "Last Line of Defense in North China"
  SHX_idea_1_desc: "As the front line against the Communist Party, the Japanese army has made a series of strategic deployments and permanent fortifications relying on the Yellow River and the Taihang Mountains. But the soldiers of the 20th Army of the North China Garrison Army are well aware: they must either eliminate all enemies here or perish here. The North China Command will no longer allow the loss of Shanxi."
  SHX_idea_2: "Collapsed Society"
  SHX_idea_2_desc: "The Japanese, adhering to their conservative strategy, chose to station troops in Shanxi, dismembering the Jin-Shaan Administrative Office, while Shaanxi was ignored, becoming a lawless zone.

  HNA_35y_idea_desc: "It is said that a legendary unit is still fighting on this isolated island. The repeated sieges by the Japanese army have not crushed their resistance, and the harsh jungle life has not diminished their will. With external aid cut off and outnumbered by the enemy, they use the earth as their bed and wild vegetables to stave off hunger. Although the Japanese have long claimed to have eradicated all forms of resistance, anti-Japanese songs are still sung by villagers, and supply lines through the mountains occasionally mysteriously disappear—the ghosts of the past seem not so distant."
  HNA_military_idea_desc: "From China's perspective, Hainan is merely a remote island in the southwestern corner, with little development value. But in the grand vision of the Japanese Empire, Hainan Island is a key link in controlling Southeast Asia. The Empire's elite army is stationed here, suppressing all resistance and maintaining control over Haikou City, the permanent base of the Combined Fleet—but this was a situation from years ago. In recent years, with frequent wars in Southeast Asia, Hainan's garrison has been repeatedly redeployed, and the rift between the army and the navy has gradually widened… Can the Empire still maintain control over this important bridgehead?"
  HNA_fortress_idea_desc: "Throughout the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere, besides us, there is no one closer to Guangdong; so naturally, the task of overseeing Guangdong falls on us. These opportunistic fools think that with the emperor far away, they can indulge themselves in Guangdong without consequence.\n\nBut these fools don't know that we are watching them all the time; when the time comes, §Vthey will pay with their blood§!."
  HNA_farsouth_transfer_station_idea_desc: "Although the vision of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity has been realized, not everyone appreciates the 'liberation and guidance' provided by Japan as the 'big brother'. In the Philippines, Malaysia, and Java, movements resisting the Empire's rule are springing up. Hainan Island, backed by the Gulf of Tonkin and overlooking the South China Sea, boasts a superior geographical position. Without the complex political system and diverse ethnic composition of Guangdong, it has gradually become the naval base and supply hub from which the Japanese Empire radiates control over Southeast Asia. Every week, countless guns, cannons, and rations are transferred through here, and countless unfortunate young men are sent from here to the hellish jungle battlefield… With such a large throughput, hidden dangers also grow…"

 MEN_attack_idea_3: "Mongolian People's Army"
 MEN_attack_idea_3_desc: "The devastating defeat in the mid-1950s cast an enduring shadow over the broken Mongolian People's Army; the Second Russian Turmoil, which began in the early 1960s, forced the still-recovering People's Army to leave its base in Tuva and return to western Mongolia.\n\nBut the key to breaking the deadlock is right before our eyes—while the People's Army struggles for survival on the devastated grasslands, an astonishing transformation is taking place in China's northwest, which once seemed like a dead land. The newly emerging Red regime seeks to unite the forces of all ethnic groups to challenge the increasingly decaying new order.\n\nAlthough the Mongolian People's Army has suffered repeated defeats over the past decade, and most of the original insurgents have perished in various battles, with support from comrades in China and the Far East, the People's Army has rapidly expanded. Today's Mongolian People's Army is composed of weather-beaten veterans and passionate young people. Their equipment may be outdated, but no one can question their years of accumulated combat experience and determination to defend their homeland.\n\n§Y‘A raven lives a thousand years without turning white; a great cause will not wither over ten thousand years.’§!"

The People's Army's steadfast march spreads from west to east across the entire grassland!\n\n§xThe old ghosts appear before everyone—it is the savior of the poor and the nightmare of traitors!§!"

In today's China, this is not the only force still resisting Japan, but it is the only one nominally maintaining independence. With the rugged terrain and the determination of its soldiers, Xikang stubbornly holds high the banner of anti-Japanese resistance…\n\nBut in reality, this is merely a desolate land abandoned by the world. The Japanese see no value in these meager resources, and the National Government, with its limited reach, cannot extend even nominal control to this area. §RThere are no passionate national warriors here, just a forgotten corner in the new order…§!"
 XIK_Chap: "Cracked"
 XIK_Chap_desc: "The Battle of Chongqing, China's last stand, saw the National Government gather all the available combat troops.

This led to poor coordination among units, command failures at the front, and ultimately a disaster that continues to this day. Today's Xikang is a place where ‘hidden talents’ are abundant, with countless ‘colonels’ leading thousands and ‘generals’ commanding tens of thousands, none of whom are subordinate to each other or willing to compromise…"
