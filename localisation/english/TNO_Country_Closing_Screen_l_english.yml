The agricultural and industrial systems have been largely established, and the influence of warlords and bandits has been eradicated. Farmers and workers fervently support the Red Army that returned from Lake Baikal, and the red sun shines once again upon this land. Local religious forces and other factions have temporarily been brought into the Anti-Japanese National United Front. These are all positive developments. However, while internal issues have been resolved, the external situation remains uncertain: to the west, Kazakhstan prepares for a unification war; to the north, the first hopeful warlords on Russian soil are scheming against each other, their attitude towards us still unknown; to the northeast, the leader of the Mengjiang puppet government, Prince, is also in a precarious position; and to the south, the mountain kingdom remains isolated. Are they enemies, or potential allies? It remains unclear. Meanwhile, in the far east, the Empire of the Rising Sun has taken notice of this flickering red star. Will they snuff out this spark on a whim, or ignore it until the flames of people's war consume the 'Co-Prosperity Sphere'? Stay tuned for the next update."
  
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_COX:1 "The victory of the Xinjiang revolution, the success of land reform, and the fervent construction of the base area... the smooth progress of events has far exceeded Mao Anying's expectations. The revolution seems to be sailing smoothly, and the revolutionary blueprint for all of China appears to be clear— or is it?\n\nNot necessarily. The border region is still trapped in endless deserts, with bandits harassing the borders day and night... not to mention to the east of the border, where an elite force of the Empire of the Rising Sun awaits the Red Army commanders.\n\nFor the light from Lake Baikal to illuminate this long-scarred land, the journey remains long and arduous. For today's China, the glimmer of light brought to the northwest by the Chinese Brigade may be weak, but it is precious. To overthrow this absurd new order, the Communist Party must take root deep in the land until it can topple the soil and crush all parasites underfoot, until that faint red star on the horizon can truly illuminate China."
