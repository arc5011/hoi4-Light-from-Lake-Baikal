  COX_news_event.7.d:0"When Long Yun raised the banner of resistance against the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the southwest, most commentators around the world dismissed it as the 'delusions of a madman'. To everyone's surprise, with the enthusiastic support of the people, the National Protection Army managed to capture Chongqing and recently pushed to the Hunan-Hubei line. Taking advantage of the Nanjing government's weakness, the Japanese army entered North China under the guise of 'peacekeeping' and effectively occupied the region.\n\nBut the hope for China's liberation remains bleak. After reaching the current front line, the National Protection Army's offensive stalled due to a shortage of troops and supply issues, while the Japanese forces have prevented their advance northward. Currently, both sides maintain a stalemate along the long front line in southern China; but if the situation remains unchanged, Long Yun's defeat seems inevitable."

  LFB_COX_nc.4.d:0"£gezifu £gezifu How did it come to this? The entire Northwestern Army doesn't know, and Tsuji Masanobu doesn't know either. A few months ago, he was the sole ruler of these tens of thousands of square kilometers of land. In the blink of an eye, Lanzhou and Tianshui were captured in quick succession, and the entire Northwestern Army was completely surrounded by the Red Army.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Wait? The Red Army?\n\n£gezifu £gezifu But Tsuji Masanobu didn't have time to think about that. He found a fast horse before the Chinese army completely surrounded the command post and fled without looking back.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'When I return to Tokyo, I will convince the military to give me another army and then return to the northwest! I will kill them all again!'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu The long ride and lack of water made the 62-year-old man gradually lose his strength, his mind becoming fuzzy, and his limbs growing weak.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Is heaven really going to end me here?'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Finally, he instinctively slowed down the horse, then used all his strength to sit on the horse.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'Huff, huff, I just need...to rest for a while...'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu When he woke up again, he found himself surrounded by the entire village, all staring at him. Tsuji Masanobu had seen that look before, in the Philippines, when a dying American POW looked at him the same way.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Tsuji Masanobu pretended to be calm as he climbed out of bed and slowly walked towards the outside of the village. The crowd automatically parted to make way for him.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu He walked out of the house, first at a walking pace, then slowly began to jog, and finally started running with all his might.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Muskets, kitchen knives, hoes, and scissors followed closely behind.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu As if it was destined, Tsuji Masanobu tripped over a rock. He quickly rolled over, staring in terror at the faces as yellow as the earth itself. He didn't recognize any of them, but they knew him.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu 'I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Help me!'"

  LFB_COX_nc.5.t:0"So Close Yet So Far"
  LFB_COX_nc.5.d:0"£gezifu £gezifu Tsuji Masanobu was now seated in the cabin, the chrysanthemum-crest sword bestowed by the Emperor placed upright between his legs, his face solemn, and his gloved hands crossed over the hilt. Seated beside him were his officers. The plane taxied on the runway and slowly took off, destination: Cangzhou. Although he had not brought the Empire a great victory in Lanzhou, the Emperor had issued a decree—given the current external threats to the Empire, every loyal soldier must rise to fight. Tsuji Masanobu was spared from committing seppuku, and the Northwestern Army was generously given a chance to redeem themselves...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Reflecting on the Emperor's mercy, Tsuji Masanobu let out a long sigh of relief. Perhaps the renewed warfare on the mainland had indeed saved the Empire of Japan, revitalizing the nation, and the Emperor had undoubtedly purged the court of traitors. His next task would be to fulfill his duty as a soldier once again, guarding North China for the Empire. On this matter, Tsuji Masanobu was confident—his expeditionary soldiers were all battle-hardened elites with a deep faith. After several days of fierce fighting, he himself had gained some understanding of the communists' favored infiltration and ambush tactics...\n\n£gezifu £gezifu Without the disadvantages of supply shortages and intelligence, the North China region, which the Empire had been cultivating for decades, was the perfect stage for his resurgence..."

When the National Protection Army stormed the gates of Nanjing from the southwest, §eJapanese devils§! had no choice but to heed the angry roar of the Chinese nation in pursuit of freedom.\n\nIt is foreseeable that the Japanese devils are about to unleash a bloody, protracted war across China, and in such circumstances, only the §Dentire Chinese nation§! united can repel the invaders and seek freedom. Now is the best time to declare war on the Japanese devils. Although we encountered setbacks in our first attempt to capture Lanzhou, we also achieved some results: the Japanese army, under our attacks, has been forced to retreat, and anti-Japanese guerrillas are active all around Lanzhou. For the freedom of the entire Chinese nation, we will face the §wwell-armed§!
