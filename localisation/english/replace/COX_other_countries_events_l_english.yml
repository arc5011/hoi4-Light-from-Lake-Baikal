POLITICS_ZHANG_ZHIZHONG_DESC:0 "Zhang Zhizhong was born in Anhui province in 1890. Like many of his peers, he was embroiled in the warlord clashes during his youth. Yet, unlike most, Zhang's battles continue to this day. He studied at Baoding Military Academy and then joined the National Revolutionary Army under the Kuomintang. During the Northern Expedition, Zhang fought bravely, achieving numerous victories; during the War of Resistance against Japan, he set aside political differences to resist the Japanese invasion alongside 400 million compatriots.\n\nAfter the war began, the Japanese attack was efficient and brutal. Despite the desperate resistance from the Chinese army, they were still no match for the dominant Japanese forces. Zhang led his troops in a staunch defense of Hunan, clashing with the Japanese for several months. However, a wrong decision nullified the sacrifice of the soldiers: Zhang somehow learned of an imminent major assault on Changsha by the Japanese and ordered the city to be set ablaze before the Japanese attack to deprive them of any resources. But in reality, it was a miscalculation on Zhang's part, resulting in the infamous Wenxi Fire. This catastrophe took countless innocent lives, and the troops defending Hunan also suffered significant losses, leading to the eventual fall of Hunan. Nevertheless, Zhang did not give up. He led his troops to Xinjiang and declared continued resistance against the invaders.\n\nXinjiang is a barren land with a harsh climate, and Zhang deeply felt the impact of this environment. Zhang's forces weren't the first to arrive in Xinjiang, and though they were the most powerful, they were not welcomed. To maintain control over Xinjiang, Zhang had to delicately balance relations between the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the local ethnic minorities. Day by day, year by year, Zhang patiently managed this remote area. His only hope is to free the homeland from its shackles and usher in a new era of freedom and revival."
Sheng_Shicai:0 "Sheng Shicai"
XIN_Sheng_Shicai_desc:0 "Deep within everyone's heart lies a dream—a distant realm that is almost untouchable in reality, crafted purely from fervent beliefs and desires. For Sheng Shicai, that dream was to become a king.\n\nHe almost succeeded, with Xinjiang as the stage of his dream's realization.\n\nIt's hard to imagine how someone from Liaoning could become known as the 'King of Xinjiang', but Sheng, with his innate luck and opportunistic nature, managed to do so. In the storm of 1933, he ousted his former superior Jin Shuren, establishing himself as the de facto ruler of Xinjiang. However, with powerful adversaries and constant challenges, the throne of Xinjiang was not easy to hold. Facing threats from Ma Zhongying and Zhang Peiyuan, Sheng sought help from the north, receiving assistance from the Red Army after promising to adopt a 'pro-Soviet, anti-imperialist' stance. This secured his rule over the land he believed was his destiny.\n\nBut promises come at a cost. To legitimize his reign, Sheng had to welcome Communist Party members from central China into his court. He watched these increasingly active communists with suspicion while silently gazing towards Inner China. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the defeat of the Nationalist Government, and Japan emerging as the new master of Asia, all unfolded before Sheng's eyes. Sheng's ambition was to be a king, not necessarily tied to Xinjiang. He cared little about Xinjiang's fate and was more focused on preserving his power. Therefore, he could easily turn to embrace Japan and slaughter the Communists, even if the former didn't truly accept him, and the latter had once been his benefactors and aides.\n\nA decade flew by. Winds from beyond the Yumen Pass grew stronger, blowing across the Gobi desert, reaching deep into the royal court of Dihua, brushing past Sheng Shicai on his throne. The facade of the 'King of Xinjiang' crumbled as people began to see him for what he truly was—an opportunist warlord who lied, slaughtered, and shamelessly collaborated with the enemy. Devoid of any means to preserve his power, Sheng could only tremble and struggle, awaiting his impending fate.\n\n— Every reign has its end, especially for mere pretenders. This time, Sheng Shicai had no place to seek absolution, and no salvation awaits him."

The_Crumbling_Six_Policies_desc:0 "§YAnti-imperialism, Pro-Japan, Peace, Integrity, Development, and Ethnic Equality§!. These are the political inventions boasted during the golden age, also known as the "Six Major Policies". In 1946, when the policy of "Pro-Soviet" in the Six Major Policies was changed to "Pro-Japan", the golden age reassured again and again that this does not mean a change in the policy of being lenient towards the Communists, nor does it mean that the Japanese can influence Xinjiang from now on. However, he failed to implement both of these guarantees.\nWith the death of Mao Zemin in the Communist Party purge of the 1950s, Xinjiang's economy fell into long-term chaos. The golden age had no choice but to actively attract Japanese investment, and voices mocking him as "proclaiming Pro-Japan, but actually being Open-to-Japan" were everywhere. §RThe Crumbling Six Policies are nearing the end of their life, just waiting for someone to give it a push, and they will collapse. §!"

Where_Are_They_desc:0 "After experiencing the Chongqing ceasefire and the Qinghai cabinet formation, the hard-liners of the Chinese Communist Party, who were dissatisfied with the central opportunist line, fled to Xinjiang and merged with Mao Zemin and the local existing socialist organizations. The growing power of the Reds made the golden age uneasy, forcing him to shed the mask of being lenient towards the Communists and carry out mass killings. Although the communists disappeared with the swing of the executioner's knife, it doesn't mean they have been annihilated.\nWhere are they? Ten years have flown by, and the communists in Xinjiang still persist in their struggle. They wander in the wilderness, appear in the streets and alleys of villages, towns, and cities, and may even have penetrated the heart of the ruling authority again; §xthey will neither forgive nor forget. §!"

Aksai Chin, which was once forcibly annexed, took the opportunity to break away and became affiliated with the Xinjiang authorities. Of course, the reason Aksai Chin did this isn't necessarily related to the local people's perception of China. Rather than saying they affiliated themselves, it's more accurate to say they extorted the Xinjiang authorities into acknowledging their semi-autonomous status and providing them with the necessary industrial products in exchange for the claim to sovereignty over Aksai Chin. §YToday, this strategic land connecting Xinjiang and Tibet has become a small independent kingdom within Xinjiang. §!"

According to the plan, this railway would connect the light textile industrial center Hami with the cotton-producing area Aksu, thereby allowing raw materials to flow more efficiently. However, with the death of Mao Zemin, the completion date of the railway was indefinitely postponed.\nFor the Xinjiang authorities, this unfinished railway left them in a dilemma. On the one hand, they don't have the ability to complete it independently, and the Japanese are not interested in this project. On the other hand, they also don't have the capacity to maintain and operate the existing lines. §YIn the eyes of many, the Hami-Aksu railway is a microcosm of Xinjiang's ten-year economic decline. §!"

JAP.2022.d:"Our unit patrolled as planned in the Jia 21 airspace, and later discovered what appeared to be a brigade-level field command facility. The second light bomber squadron under our command immediately launched an attack upon discovery. The enemy was caught off guard. We used eleven 500 kg bombs and twenty 250 kg bombs. The attack was highly effective. Multiple angles from different aircraft confirmed that no one from that brigade survived. \nAccording to the radio frequencies monitored by our allies, the command center belonged to the 'Imperial Guard 88th Brigade'. In the previous Mongolia conflict, this brigade showed excellent combat efficiency, excelling in ambushes, guerrilla warfare, and frequently harassing our supplies, often slowing down our Mongolian and Xinjiang offensive. According to our intelligence, this unit was not originally part of the 'People's Revolutionary Committee' combat lineup. But why did such a proficient unit suddenly appear on the Mongolian battlefield? The reasons are still under investigation."

Ning_Ma: "Ningxia Ma Lineage"
Ning_Ma_desc: "After the defeat in Lanzhou, a portion of the Ningxia Ma lineage retreated with us to Xining. Although Qinghai and Ningxia always considered themselves part of the same Ma family and should have jointly resisted Japan, now, due to the broken balance of power, the Ningxia Ma lineage has to rely on others. The gap between the two Ma families is deepening due to the loss of Lanzhou by the Qinghai Ma and the internal turmoil."
Hanhui_conflict: "Refugee conflict"
Hanhui_conflict_desc: "The war twenty years ago swept the country, causing heavy damage to the people of the Central Plains. During the frenzied sweep of the Japanese army at the end of the war, many refugees chose to flee to the northwest, one of the few places in China that had not been completely ravaged by war. The influx of refugees supplemented the scarce labor force in the northwest, saving Qinghai's economy, which was on the brink of collapse due to previous exploitation and wars. However, the influx of refugees sharpened ethnic tensions in Qinghai, and discrimination was mainly against outsiders by the local ethnic minorities and Han people."
An_economy_of_exhaustion_and_fishing: "An economy of exhaustion and overfishing"
An_economy_of_exhaustion_and_fishing_desc: "Chinese warlords have always had a 'good' tradition of developing the economy. In Sichuan in the 1930s, warlords collected taxes up to 1991. The Ma family in Qinghai had a similar approach to developing the economy. The Ma family expanded its family business every decade, brutally exploited the masses under its rule, and recklessly pursued profits, leading to the bankruptcy of thousands of small producers in the northwest. The endless conscription reduced the farming population significantly. The establishment of the Huangzhong Corporation symbolized the complete formation of the Ma family's monopoly, with the whole of Qinghai suffering endlessly under its exploitation. Behind the 'prosperity of the northwest' is the full purse of the Ma family and Qinghai's collapsing economy."
Xibei_jun: "Headquarters of the Northwestern Army"
Xibei_jun_desc: "After the Northwestern Anti-banditry campaign of the Reorganized National Government failed, the Northwestern Ma family once touted itself as the last legitimate remnant of the Republic of China and constantly threatened the interior. To ensure the safety of the cornerstone of the co-prosperity sphere and to sideline some pro-war officers, the Northwestern Field Army was born. \nAs this imposing anti-banditry force entered the hinterland of northwest China, it felt like a no man's land. The rebel guerrillas, who once struck hard at the reorganized National Government troops, didn't dare to show their faces. The Northwestern Field Army advanced to Gansu and clashed with the Ma warlords in Lanzhou. The Ma family's proud Lanzhou bunkers were easily removed by the Northwestern Field Army. The struggling Ma forces retreated to Xining in a panic. The invincible Northwestern Field Army was about to continue its advance to Xining and completely end the rebel forces in northwest China... but bad news has already arrived. The Northwestern Field Army has gone too deep into enemy territory. Supplies along the way were attacked by red bandit rebels. Even within the territory of the Reorganized National Government, the supplies from Tokyo were sparse after being exploited by various warlords. Lacking supplies, with uncertain weapons, and no reinforcements, after repeated sweeps, there were no additional food sources in the territories controlled by the Northwestern Field Army. They have now become an isolated army trapped in northwest China. Can they retreat? No, they can't, not just because of the honor of the Imperial Japanese Army, but more importantly, for the glory of the highest command of the Northwestern Field Army, they can't take a single step back."
"Supply_lines_across_East_Asia: "The Long Supply Lines"
Supply_lines_across_East_Asia_desc: "Every day, advanced weapons produced by the Japanese Empire are loaded onto ferries and cross the ocean to arrive in China. They are then loaded onto trains, trucks, and even animal carts, crossing the vast lands of East Asia. After a long journey, they endure the numerous exploitations of the reorganized Nationalist government and face repeated attacks from the guerilla forces that were once the ghosts of the past in the northwest, before they reach the frontline of the war in the northwest. This undoubtedly proves the unmatched influence of the Japanese Empire, but it also results in significant losses."
Anti_Japanese_guerrilla_army: "Northwest Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Army"
Anti_Japanese_guerrilla_army_desc: "Occupying Lanzhou is not the end of the anti-bandit campaign; it's just a major obstacle. Even though the Ma faction has retreated to Xining, guerrilla groups are active everywhere in the territories occupied by the Northwest Army, including Lanzhou. Rebels who oppose the imperial army are everywhere. What exacerbates the situation for the Northwest Army is that not only have local guerrillas sprung up around Lanzhou, but guerrilla groups that were once red specters in northwest Shaanxi have also become active. These guerrillas loot the supply lines to strengthen themselves, and their power is constantly growing."

POLITICS_MA_JIYUAN_DESC: 0 "Compared to the fertile heartland of the Central Plains, the northwest is a harsh land. Nestled among mountains, various ethnic groups coexist, creating a unique social landscape. Under the rule of the Ma family for half a century, although it's not prosperous, it has been peaceful and stable. Under the foresight of the Northwestern King, Ma Bufang, even the raging Anti-Japanese War did not significantly affect the region. Escaping the chaos of war and favored by the Japanese, the northwest became one of the earliest regions to rise after the war. For a time, the Ma family made a fortune, and Lanzhou was hailed as the 'Jiangnan of the Frontier.' But all these were before the invasion of the Japanese army. \nIn just a few years, the war completely changed the face of the northwest. The illusion of prosperity was shattered, and underlying conflicts erupted violently. After a major defeat in Lanzhou, Ma Jiyuan lost his father, the Ma family lost its pillar, and the remnants retreated to Xining, but the army was disorganized and lacked ammunition. Faced with crisis, Ma Jiyuan hastily buried his father and took up the heavy responsibility of the Northwestern King. Now in the northwest, enemies lurk both inside and out, the people live in fear, and there are even rifts among brothers. But the wealth accumulated by the Ma family over half a century is not to be underestimated, and the fierce men of the northwest won't be easily defeated. Before Ma Jiyuan lies a path full of thorns, but this young man is determined to pave a way through!\n If he's not knocked down by adversity, the young steed will eventually travel a thousand miles and shake the world."

GAN.114514.t: "Renewal of Everything"
GAN.114514.d: "As usual, Nikola woke up early today, with the sun still not risen, and the east still pale. He then went to the bathroom, following the morning routine he had learned as a child, indicating that today would be like any other day for Nikola. After freshening up, he ironed and neatly hung the old military uniform that had been with him for over two decades in the wardrobe, deviating from the norm momentarily. However, this was quickly replaced by the new military uniform he pulled out from the wardrobe.\n He had just received this new uniform from the Kamchatka Naval Committee yesterday, and today he couldn't wait to wear it. He looked at himself in the mirror, the uniform was finely made, with golden buttons on the blue cuffs that shone brilliantly under the light. These buttons were engraved with the Soviet emblem, showcasing intricate details. The black leather holster around his waist complemented the black leather boots he wore, with the Soviet emblem decorating the cap. The reflection looked imposing and powerful. \nHe saluted the mirror in satisfaction, then opened his wardrobe to caress the old, wrinkled uniform that had been with him for over twenty years, whispering his farewells. After a while, Nikola closed the wardrobe, put on his new cap, and left the room in his boots. He was going to attend the medal awarding ceremony of the committee wearing this new uniform. Everything was brand new, from the uniform to the medal, from Nikola to the Naval Committee. Everything in Kamchatka will get a new face after today, and the new uniforms on the soldiers are just a part of this renewal."

GAN.1919810.d: "The central hall in Petropavlovsk was buzzing with excitement. Soldiers holding red flags stood on either side of the stairs, awaiting the arrival of soldiers and officers for the medal awarding ceremony. \nSoon, sailors in their brand-new uniforms climbed the steps and entered the hall, where leaders of the Naval Committee stood solemnly waiting for them. Nikola rarely had the opportunity to personally experience such grand ceremonies and was almost speechless in admiration. He had already reserved a spot on his new uniform for the medal. Lowering his head, he looked at the left side of his chest, which was still empty. But he wasn't worried. He knew that General Yumashev would soon present him with the medal, and might even pin it on him personally – a thought that thrilled him immensely. \nNikola hardly paid attention to the general's speech; he was lost in thoughts of proudly displaying his medal. \nHe never doubted his faith, and now, the honor of this faith was manifested in the medals on his chest. Without a doubt, the medal awarding ceremony of the Naval Committee inspired Nikola and the other sailors to march towards their great ideals. There's no denying that these sailors would be even more fervent in moving forward after this."
