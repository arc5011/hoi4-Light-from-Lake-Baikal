  #党内路线斗争决议组
line_struggle: "Party Internal Line Struggle"
line_struggle_desc:0 "The internal ideological disputes within the Chinese Communist Party have been ongoing. A significant portion of the soldiers in the Chinese brigade are either refugee peasants or former overseas laborers. Their experiences, from the orderly life under the Black Army's anarchic communes to the Leninist ideals in Buryatia, have given them a deeper understanding and pursuit of equality and socialist ideals. Since they came from the shores of Lake Baikal — the current Red Liberation Zone — they are called the §RRed Zone Faction§!. Liu Shaoqi's faction, known as the §wWhite Zone Faction§!, due to their long-term resistance in occupied regions, have become accustomed to a bureaucratic management style. Both factions showed revolutionary zeal during the previous struggles against enemies. But after the liberation of Xinjiang, the unique diplomatic environment and the interests acquired during the process have amplified the differences between the two factions. \nBesides the Red and White factions, there's a group known as the §MRadical Faction§!. Their stance is similar to the Red Zone Faction, but after witnessing the defeats in Yagoda, Mongol-Xinjiang, and Sheng Shicai, they advocate a more aggressive military strategy to quickly and cleanly complete the revolutionary cause. Although currently, the Radical Faction is just a loose group within the Red Zone Faction, many comrades don't like the prolonged line struggle. If we invest too much energy in political campaigns, the influence of the Radical Faction will rapidly grow. \n\n§RRed Zone Faction§!'s current party influence is [Root.Gethong_qu_pai]\n§wWhite Zone Faction§!'s current party influence is [Root.Getbai_qu_pai]\n§MRadical Faction§!'s current party influence is [Root.Getji_jin_pai]"
