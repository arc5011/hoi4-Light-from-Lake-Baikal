#Party Line Struggle Decision Group
line_struggle: "Party Line Struggle"
line_struggle_desc:0 "The internal line struggle within the Communist Party of China has been ongoing. Many of the soldiers of the Chinese Brigade are refugees or former overseas laborers. From the orderly life in the anarchist communes of the Black Army to the Leninist ideals in Buryatia, their experiences have deepened their understanding and pursuit of equality and socialist ideals. Coming from the shores of Lake Baikal—the current Red liberated zone—they are known as the §RRed Zone Faction§!. Meanwhile, the local faction led by Liu Shaoqi, accustomed to the bureaucratic management style due to their long resistance in the already fallen White Zone, is known as the §wWhite Zone Faction§!. During the hardship of the past struggles against the enemy, both factions displayed revolutionary zeal. However, after the liberation of Xinjiang, the relatively independent diplomatic environment and the interests gained during the takeover of Xinjiang have exacerbated the contradictions between the two factions.\nApart from the Red and White factions, there is also a §MRadical Faction§! that exists. Although their overall stance aligns with the Red Zone Faction, after witnessing the collapse of Yagoda, Mengjiang, and Sheng Shicai, they advocate for a more radical military strategy to swiftly and decisively complete the revolutionary cause. Although the Radical Faction is currently just a loose group within the Red Zone Faction, objectively speaking, many comrades do not favor prolonged line struggles; if we invest too much effort in political maneuvering, the influence of the Radical Faction could grow rapidly.\n\n§RThe current party influence of the Red Zone Faction is [Root.Gethong_qu_pai]\n§wThe current party influence of the White Zone Faction is [Root.Getbai_qu_pai]\n§MThe current party influence of the Radical Faction is [Root.Getji_jin_pai]"
