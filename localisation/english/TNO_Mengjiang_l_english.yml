POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "How should one address Prince Demchugdongrub? A hero of Mongolia? A traitor to the Chinese nation? Born in 1902 in the Right Wing of Sunit, he is the only son of Prince Namjil Wangchuk, the 31st generation descendant of the Golden Family. Six years later, Prince Demchugdongrub inherited his father's title with the approval of the Aisin Gioro imperial family and was also imbued with the essence of Chinese culture. Among the various historical figures from ancient and modern times, Demchugdongrub most admired his ancestor—Genghis Khan. He spent his entire life pursuing Genghis Khan's legacy.\n\nIn 1931, he succeeded as the Chief of the Xilingol League. At this time, the vast Mongolian grasslands seemed to have changed: the Qing Empire had fallen, replaced by the Republic of China under the Beiyang Government, which, under Russian machinations, lost Outer Mongolia. In these turbulent times, Prince Demchugdongrub decided to take his chances. The later Mukden Incident allowed him to exploit Nanjing's fears to initiate the Pan-Mongolian Autonomy Movement. However, the negotiations eventually broke down due to the Han chauvinism of Chiang Kai-shek and his followers. Driven by a strong desire for Mongolian independence, Prince Demchugdongrub resorted to a last measure—seeking assistance from the Kwantung Army, even though he knew well their treacherous nature.\n\nYears of struggle have partially fulfilled his dreams. After nine years of the Greater East Asia War, the Mongolian Autonomous Government defeated Soviet puppet forces and reclaimed lost territory following the Siberian Intervention. Despite these great achievements, Mongolia remains ununified, let alone independent. Legally, Mengjiang is still a vassal of Wang Jingwei and his lackeys; in practice, Mengjiang is merely a fiefdom of the Kwantung Army. The lands of Eastern Mongolia remain under Manchurian control, and the resistance in Outer Mongolia keeps the Prince restless.\n\nSome scorn him as a traitor who has shamed the spirit of Genghis Khan, while others criticize him as a vassal upstart living in a fantasy. In some respects, the Prince agrees with these judgments. However, he refuses to follow the path of his former lord, Puyi, and become a mere puppet of Japan. After Nanjing announced its modernization plan, Demchugdongrub warily realized that the storm of revolution was about to return to Greater East Asia. Perhaps now is the last moment for him to prove himself as a worthy descendant of Genghis Khan and the final chance to liberate Mongolia from the oppressors."

men.1.d:0 "Prince Demchugdongrub of Mengjiang personally thanked the Emperor for the assistance provided during the recent unrest. He also assured us that order would be restored on the Mongolian steppe. It seems that the bandits only had the upper hand at the beginning, but neither their discipline nor their military strength could compare to that of the Prince. As we speak, the remnants of the rebels are being crushed. The Japanese who fled due to the chaotic situation are returning, and as the last batch of traitors and thieves flee from Mengjiang to the Russian wilderness, Japan can continue to develop its trade."
men.1.a:0 "As it should be."
men.2.t:0 "Mengjiang Has Fallen..."
men.2.d:0 "Our troops have lost confidence in the Prince and his regime over the past few weeks, and the final outcome was not unexpected. A small retinue and bodyguards are escorting the Prince—the last symbol of 'Mengjiang'—to Manchukuo. Many in our government are demanding the reconquest of Mengjiang, arguing that failing to restore order is an irresponsible act. However, others are tired of the situation and have no desire to deal with Mongolia or the Prince's failed regime any longer."

men.3.t:0 "The Fate of Mongolia"
men.3.d:0 "After a decisive battle, our forces have once again secured victory on the steppes, and order has been restored in Mongolia. However, a new problem has emerged: what to do with the former Mengjiang? The Prince would be shocked and angry if he learned that his authority would not be reestablished, as many believe it would further worsen the already dire situation. Of course, some have already lost faith in the Prince, arguing that his return would only lead to a repeat of today's war ten years from now. Going forward, the Mengjiang issue will require some new approaches."
men.3.a:0 "The Prince of Mongolia needs to return to his throne."
men.4.t:0 "The Nobles Have Won!"
men.4.d:0 "Today, we have achieved victory! The rebellion is over, and Mongolia has been saved. The only task remaining is the final cleanup. With order restored, all additional aid from Japan will be withdrawn. While fighting has never truly ceased in Mongolia, it is now clear that peace is on the horizon: the skies will no longer roar with the thunder of bomb explosions, and the earth will no longer tremble under the hoofbeats of horses. The Prince breathes a sigh of relief, and the Mongol warriors once again follow closely behind."
men.4.a:0 "Everything as it should be."
men.5.t:0 "Our Legitimate Territory"
men.5.d:0 "Prince Demchugdongrub, with his great wisdom, envisioned a better, stronger, and more united future for Mongolia long ago. For decades, he has tirelessly worked towards this grand goal, and the people of Mongolia have stood by him out of loyalty and the righteousness of his cause. The only exception is those isolated Mongolians living under the Communist scourge. In western Mongolia, they spread their filth, ignoring their rightful ruler. Recently, we even clashed with a force led by a Communist general. But now, we are finally united, ready to liberate those living under the rule of the People's Revolutionary Council, and truly unite our people."
men.5.a:0 "It should have been done long ago."
men.6.t:0 "The Ulaanbaatar Uprising"
men.6.d:0 "The history of the Mongolian steppes has always revolved around division and conflict, teaching its people a lesson—unity is strength. From the earliest Xiongnu Confederation to the world-renowned Mongol Empire in 1206, it has been proven that when the Mongol tribes gather their strength and unite as one, they are unstoppable. Yet, time and again, we fall into internal strife, becoming slaves to the Chinese. In the Great War, with the help of our great leader and Japanese friends, Mongolia once again united its people. Following in the footsteps of Modu Chanyu and Genghis Khan, for the first time in centuries, he has united the people in his name, although not everyone agrees, he seems to have successfully earned his place among Mongolia's great rulers.\n\nBut today, the beautiful Mongolian steppes have once again seen division and bloodshed. Just a few weeks ago, bandits and Communist rebels swept across the Mongolian plains, catching our armed forces off guard and once again dividing our people. With a combination of luck and cunning, these bandits have gained the upper hand, even occupying our capital, Urga, which the Reds call 'Ulaanbaatar.' This cannot be tolerated! Mongolians will no longer fight their brotherly kin with Chinese knives in their backs. Our great Prince Demchugdongrub has called upon every true Mongolian to defend their country and monarch with the courage and passion of a thousand men. We will defeat these bandits, liberate Khüree from their hands, and show these foolish traitors the price of betrayal."
men.6.a:0 "Summon the nobles, crush the traitors!"
men.7.t:0 "Bombs from Japan!"
men.7.d:0 "Ulaanbaatar has been engulfed in death and destruction! Those cowardly Japanese, knowing we lack air defenses, have begun shamelessly bombing our troops and people. Without honor, the Japanese, supported by their government, are terrorizing the innocent and even attacking defenseless civilians. Their jets know they have nothing to fear from our swords and guns, boldly diving over Ulaanbaatar, dropping bombs and missiles on our roads and buildings. While the common people are frightened out of their wits, our troops suffer even more. Bombs and bullets from the sky slaughter our warriors, reaping the lives of those with no place to hide or flee across the vast Mongolian plains. This is no war, no battle; it is shameful murder."
men.7.a:0 "Cowards!"
men.8.t:0 "A Swift War"
men.8.d:0 "Our communications with Prince Demchugdongrub and our own deployed pilots have painted a beautiful picture of what is happening on the Mongolian steppes. Under modern airpower, Mongolian loyalists, and our material support, the fate of the Mongolian rebels was sealed long ago. It seems that soon, the Mongolian steppes will be safe once more, and peace will return to Asia."
men.8.a:0 "As it should be."
men.9.t:0 "The War Continues"
men.9.d:0 "It is clear that the situation in Mongolia is not developing in Japan's favor. The Prince has failed to seize the initiative or quell the Red rebel uprising, squandering our generous aid. As the war drags on, we can no longer see any benefit, and our generals are gradually losing patience with our Mongolian allies. We must change our current policy, either by intervening directly to end the uprising or by simply washing our hands of the matter."
men.9.a:0 "We must take control of the situation."
men.9.b:0 "Enough, we will not waste more resources on these clowns."
men.10.t:0 "Training the Mongolian Army"
men.10.d:0 "'Hey, Toyoda-kun, isn't it hot as hell today?' said the young Mongolian as he walked into the sergeant's tent.\n\n'Idiot, Altan. And you're not allowed to call me 'kun,' I'm still your superior officer!' \n\n'Alright, Toyoda-san,' Altan replied in his rough but clear Japanese.\n\nTwo months ago, Sergeant Toyoda was reassigned as an advisor to a Mongolian platoon, part of the first 'Observation Group' deployed to Mengjiang. His job was simple—to train Mongolians according to the doctrines and traditions of the Imperial Japanese Army. It sounded easy, at least at first—until he actually had to train these soldiers.\n\nThe Mengjiang Army was a hodgepodge of auxiliaries, former bandits, and professional soldiers. Almost no one could understand Japanese, let alone converse in it. The language barrier, combined with the extreme prejudice and contempt the Japanese advisors had for the Mongolians, made unit cohesion almost impossible, and Toyoda's unit was no exception.\n\n'Don't get the wrong idea, Altan, I still think you're nothing but worthless dog shit, but you're just a bit better than the rest—a taller dwarf in a crowd of midgets—and that's good enough for me.'\n\n'Why did you call me here then?'\n\n'Well, I'm appointing you as squad leader—I've seen you fight those rebels—and believe me, I won't miss a good soldier, especially one who isn't afraid of machine guns or being captured.'\n\nSergeant Toyoda walked out of the tent, slowly lit a cigarette, and took a deep drag before he left, he gently patted Altan on the shoulder. In the silence and solitude, Altan pondered some questions, unsure whether fighting his own people was worth it—but for him, despite its short-sightedness, joining the Japanese meant a new beginning in his life."
men.10.a:0 "The Rising Sun remains supreme."
men.11.t:0 "New Auxiliary Forces"
men.11.d:0 "Our friends in the Imperial Japanese Army have returned the first batch of Mongolian trainees to active duty. Although their numbers have decreased, their fighting spirit has become as tough as steel, a far cry from what they were before. They pride themselves on the harsh training they've endured, showing no mercy to the weak. They stand tall, every button on their uniforms perfectly aligned. These men have been forged by the Japanese from soft clay into the sharp swords of the Emperor and the Prince."

Our ally, Prince Demchugdongrub, as in the 1950s, has failed to contain the flames of rebellion, and it seems he has failed once again. While we have not yet become directly involved in this conflict, watching as Japanese citizens flee what was just weeks ago 'friendly territory,' it seems we may have to support the Prince once more."

Mongolia was the last place he wanted to be assigned to: no prospects for promotion and constant battles with enemies who could disappear into the desert dunes at any moment. However, today was different from usual; his detachment was besieging a small town stubbornly defended by Zedenbal's forces.\n\n'Hey, Tetsu! When the hell is our air support going to get here? I'm about to die out here—if Zedenbal wants, he could personally shoot me right now—'\n\nTetsu's sharp glare shut the rookie lieutenant up. Though it wasn't apparent from their ranks, Corporal Asano had been fighting on Mongolian soil for several months, witnessing everything from the notorious flayed prisoners of the Kwantung Army's 42nd Battalion to Japanese and Mongolian mummified bodies huddled around a small barrel of water in the desert.\n\n'Not going to say anything, huh?' the lieutenant said as he picked up his rifle and tied his headscarf.\n\n'Lieutenant Asano, please shut your mouth.'\n\nThe young officer didn't heed the veteran's warning, climbing out of the trench. The heat from the desert was driving him crazy. The Mongolian auxiliaries tried to pull Asano back to safety but failed.\n\nIt wasn't until the shockwave from a dive-bombing attack sent the delirious lieutenant flying from the sand that he saw the last thing before passing out—a brilliant streak of orange, followed by a suffocating black cloud. Asano gradually lost consciousness, barely hearing the screams of burning Mongolian soldiers in the distance."

men.27.d:0 "The Mengjiang National Army is poorly equipped and inadequately trained, barely sufficient to handle bandits or maintain domestic security. While we cannot do much about their morale and individual capabilities, we can still support their efforts against Zedenbal's rebels on the plains by providing them with some (relatively) modern equipment.\n\nDue to post-war budget constraints and balance, most wartime weapons have been sealed in the Imperial Army and Navy's inventory, primarily used for training, ceremonial purposes, and as emergency reserves. However, even so, the weapons held by units on the continent far exceed their needs. Therefore, our observers in Mengjiang suggest relinquishing some of these stored items, such as wartime Type 99 rifles and some artillery, to properly arm the Mengjiang forces.\n\nThis arms sale not only earns revenue for our treasury but also lays the foundation for transforming the Mengjiang Army from a ragtag group into a competent force for counterinsurgency and bandit suppression. Though the equipment we send may be outdated, it will at least provide a basis for training the Mengjiang Army into a functional fighting force."

 men.12.d:0 "Status Report 57A - North China Area Army (TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY)\n\nFOREWORD: Prince Demchugdongrub's forces of the Mongol United Autonomous Government has been battling the forces of Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal's rebel government in the far steppes of Mongolia. Mongolia, while a backwater compared to the riches of Manchuria and China, is still a vital communications and logistics hub for transport through Beijing. As such, Prince Demchugdongrub's forces should be aided by the forces of the North China Area Army as much as possible. Colonel Kodohara, representing our Chief of Staff had come up with three proposals:\n\n(a.) The provision of air support from the 17th and 33rd Fighter Groups, as well as the bomber group of the Genzan Kokutai. The lowest possible commitment we can make, this would still mean significantly to the Prince's forces - intelligence reports have stated that the air capacities of Tsedenbal's rebels are lacking.\n\n(b.) Same as option (a.), but with the additional provision of the 33rd Reserve Battalion - as an advisor group for the Prince's forces on the ground. This would increase the land capabilities of the Mengjiang Army - but might be seen as a waste of resources if the Prince loses the war in the steppe.\n\n(c.) Same as option (a.), but with the added provision of the 2nd Armoured Brigade. The heaviest commitment we are able to make, this would increase the Prince's chances of victory exponentially - at the cost of massively lost political capital if the Prince were to be defeated.\n\nSigned: Lieutenant General Ishihara Tadachi, GHQ Outer Mongolia Observatory Group."

Doubtless this will be a great help to our forces as the enemy has no viable air defenses, and the moral of our enemy must suffer in the face of airborne annihilation!"
 men.14.d:0 "Our pleas to the Japanese emperor have not gone unheard, and today our Prince has received word that Japan will aid us with air support along with officers to train and equip our troops for battle. The twin fists of Japanese aerial bombardment and the famous fighting spirit of the Imperial Army will doubtless give our men the upper hand in battle."
 men.15.d:0 "Our pleas to the Japanese have not gone unheard, and today our Prince received word that the Japanese were indeed generous to us. We can shortly expect not only Japanese air support and military advisors but even a full IJA armored brigade. The generals are practically giddy with the thought of not one but two Japanese forces which the enemy has no good response to joining the battle. This conflict must now surely turn in our favor."

For him, today's bombing run was merely another mission - whoever the targets were to be. Civilian or military, the Outer Mongolia Area Army couldn't take any chances - any potential resupply base for Tsedenbal's forces was a threat to the success of the campaign.\n\n\"No resistance, eh Cap? They'd usually swarm us with ack-ack by now!\" shouted Ito's (perhaps, overly) enthusiastic, door gunner.\n\n\"Shut the fuck up, Takayama, just focus on hitting your targets.\"\n\nTakayama cocked back his light machine gun's bolt, and loaded up high-explosive rounds. He'd been on enough missions to know which missions involved \"soft\" targets and which ones involved \"hard\" targets. Today's mission was \"soft\" - so far. At least until several airburst rounds scattered around the helicopter - maybe this target would not be as \"soft\" as Suzume-1-A expected.\n\n\"Bakayama, take out that fucking AA gun on the right! Everyone hang on, we're going in hot!\" shouted Ito.\n\n\"Suzume-1-A, Suzume-1-A! We took a hit! Going do-\", as the helicopter next to Ito exploded in a beautiful orange plume.\n\n\"Suzume-1-A to all Suzume-1 units, finish your runs, we're off for today. Good job Bakayama, scratch ten to your name when we get back!\"\n\nIn their jubilation and the rush of adrenaline, the pilots of Suzume-1 just barely missed the column of bloodied and wounded refugees pouring out of the complex, shrouded by the black plumes of an ammunition dump's explosion."

While pursuing what they thought was a fleeing enemy a pair of what we can only assume were armored tanks hit them from the side. While many were killed in the initial blast the true mauling came when the foolhardy commander ordered a screaming charge on the new foe. Our horsemen were mowed down in scores and the shattered remnants fled for their lives, some of the more isolated among them not even knowing what kind of beast had attacked them. It seems a new foe has appeared, one to which we have few good responses."

While Prince Demchugdongrub has repeatedly assured our commanders that the Mengjiang Army will suffice for the operations in the steppe, and that \"victory is within our grasp\", his claims get less and less convincing with each passing day.\n\nThis presents us with a bubbling, but still manageable crisis, especially among the notoriously insubordinate Kwantung Army. Some of the more jingoistic and independent-minded officers want to directly drag Tokyo into the Mongolian rebellion, but this could lead to a dangerous precedence of wasting men, resources and materiel into small-scale conflicts that our proxies should be able to solve by themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the idea of direct intervention isn't that bad, as it gives us an opportunity to experiment with airborne and helicopter tactics in coordination with armoured and motorised thrusts - a doctrinal boost in an ever-modernising battlefield. In addition, it also gives some of our newly-graduated airmen a proving ground - the skies of Mongolia are vast, and there's little opposition to shoot them down.\n\nLastly, it will remind Prince Demchugdongrub to not get cocky in his internal affairs, and hopefully this would be the end of our massive investments in the Mongolian conflict."

 men.28.d:0 "Northwestern China had always been a backwater - a death sentence for the careers of the once-promising, a quiet retirement home for the weary, and a containment ground for the most rabid of IJA officers and personnel. While this odd mix of competence and incompetence was sufficient for peacetime operations such as anti-bandit raids as well as basic garrisoning, this shall not suffice for an actual war, or a large-scale rebellion.\n\nWith the escalation of Tsedenbal's rebellion, it would be wise for us to pour in more trained and effective assets into the North China Area Army. Specifically, deploying motorised and airborne assets would be useful for us to intervene readily in the Mongolian steppes in case Prince De's government falls to Tsedenbal's forces. In any case, we should ready forward cadres of these units and send them to Mengjiang as soon as possible - to act as forward operating units, as well as advisors for the Mengjiang National Army.\n\nHopefully, with this deployment we can increase the fighting capabilities of the Prince's army - with luck, we can extend our influence far to the Northwest against the Russians."
 men.28.a:0 "The benevolent Japanese hand guides all."
 men.29.d:0 "While the Mengjiang National Army is descended from the once-valiant cavalry armies of the Khans, modern warfare has long supplanted the role of the horse on the battlefield. As seen multiple times in the Great War and the Greater East Asian War, cavalry has faltered to the advent of artillery and machine guns... except in specific circumstances.\n\nIn the far-flung deserts of Mongolia and Western China, the horse has still kept its usefulness and importance in the harsh environment. Tsedenbal's horse cavalry and mounted infantry have proven to be scarily effective in wearing down the Mengjiang National Army, be it through hit-and-run raids or reconnaissance missions which lay traps for the Prince's army. Through our experience in Manchukuo and Gansu, elements of the North China Area Army have also proven themselves adept in cavalry tactics.\n\nIt would be wise for us to loan cavalry vedettes to the Prince's army, especially if they would be augmented by our superior airpower and electronics capabilities. What the sand dune hinders, the aircraft will overcome - what the rainstorm hinders, the horse troop will overcome."
 men.30.d:0 "The relative unimportance of Northwestern China in the greater strategic picture has led to our forces neglecting needs both material and non-material for our allies in Mengjiang and the Hui State. While previously deemed to be a necessary sacrifice in favour of concentrating our efforts in the Pacific and China proper, it has come to haunt us in the wake of Tsedenbal's rebellion.\n\nWhile an extra diversion of cavalry and horse transport units has made it easier for us to supply Prince De's forces in the field, we should focus on gaining an advantage over Tsedenbal's forces through our superior technological capabilities. Namely, extending the Kalgan rail network would do wonders to supplying Mengjiang's cities and towns, even beyond Kalgan itself. However, construction might be costly - considering the harshness of the terrain.\n\nWe can only hope that the Kalgan rail network's expansion would be a welcome addition to our ever-increasing investment in the Northeast, and would aid us in defeating Tsedenbal's rebellion even quicker - there are more pressing needs for our construction companies and resources."

 men.31.t:0 "The Northwestern Conference"
 men.31.d:0 "Prince De's administration stands on a platform of Mongolian nationalism guided by the benevolent Japanese hand, but anyone who looks at Mengjiang for more than five seconds knows that the concept is built upon a throne of lies. While this approach would have worked in the 1930s, when our influence over Asia was still in flux, it has been nearly 30 years since the establishment of Mengjiang - and the Mongol populace has not remained idle.\n\nIt would be wise for us to realign our dealings with Prince De to unite the mixed loyalties of the princelings under his purview - as an anti-Bolshevik front upholding the noble traditions of the Mongol nation, though ostensibly still under the firm, guiding hand of the Japanese. With this in mind, the North China Area Army has proposed that an All-Mongolian Conference of Unity is to be held in Beijing - neutral, safe ground away from the front lines, with the idea of forming a pan-Mongolian, anti Bolshevik front against Tsedenbal's forces.\n\nThose in attendance would be the high-ranking commanders of the Kwantung Army and the North China Area Army, as well as the Minister of Finance, Kanemaru Shin. With luck, we would be able to unite the disparate Mongol princes of the northwest, and make a concrete effort to ensure Tsedenbal's rebellion does not threaten our supremacy in the steppes."

 men.32.d:0 "In the far northwest of our Empire, what was once a relatively quiet backwater has erupted into open rebellion. The Tsagaan Mongol Ulus, led by former Bolshevik Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, has seized control of the far west from Prince Demchugdongrub's Mengjiang National Army. While a minor rebellion at present, losing Mongolia would mean losing our reaches into the far north and Central Asia, as well as threatening supply lines and our positions in Northern China. Should the war not go in our favour however, the hawks in the Imperial Japanese Army would have a sufficient warchest to knock down the standing of our administration.\n\nThe Japanese have sent sorties of Kenpeitai Agents across the border to keep a watchful eye over the recently recovered lands of our Empire. They arrived in great trails of heavy-duty military vehicles chugging across the Mongolian frontiers, secluding themselves from the National Army's high command. They were here to 'handle' communist guerrillas behind the frontline whilst we focused on the enemy, we were told by Tokyo, but their sinister appearance signaled as if they were here for much more than partisans. Unloading truckloads of equipment and arms, the uniformed agents drew particular attention from our own men who were apprehensive of such an unsettling presence.\n\nTheir silence was foreboding, as it seemed they refused to speak to anyone other than who they were permitted to. We thank them and shake their hands for their service now, but with whispers and suspicion of ulterior motives, must remain aware of their praetorian position within our borders."

 MEN_Saving_the_Country_desc:0 "This great land, sacred home to the great Mongolian peoples, has for generations been divided and weak. A people who were once lead by great Khans riding over the whole earth and making fools of the Chinese had become wretched vassals. Now we are once more united and free but for the treasonous men who we now must face. Let the pure sky and steppe not be polluted by these criminals, to arms!"
 MEN_Destroy_Resistance_Agents_desc:0 "The people are being lead astray by the insidious agents of the rebellion; like a plague rat wherever they are found soon after the sickness of discontent rears its head.

 MEN_Destabilize_the_Ulaanbataar_Rebels_desc:0 "While the rebellion captured much territory and people this does not mean the occupied land is secure. The hearts of the loyal remain true even behind enemy lines and the enemy caravans are guarded only by the lightest of arms. By raiding the enemy and empowering those still true to us the bastard enemy will falter."
 MEN_By_the_Princes_Orders_desc:0 "Prince Demchugdongrub was born into a servile and divided Mongolia, home to an atomized and nearly forgotten people. But by his hand and in the way of the great Khan from who he is descended the Prince struck out against all of his peoples enemies. It is such a great man who the people are commanded by, and who they should love and fear in equal measure. For by his orders, we ride."
 MEN_For_the_Final_Victory_desc:0 "This is it: the final push. Our battles and skirmishes so far have not yielded any decisive victory, and the broken state of the Mongol people persists against all that is right, and the peoples own will.

 MEN_The_Relentless_Attack_desc:0 "We will not and frankly cannot allow this rebelion to continue. It must be crushed totally and swiftly.

The harsher the war, the better the peace is a time honored fact, so let us go forth and conquer."
 MEN_Nomadic_Legacy_desc:0 "From the earliest days of childhood every Mongol knows the horse, and in his song and dance the horse remains. It was on horseback that the Mongol race made a name for itself and it is this unique and unsurpassed tradition of horsemanship which must be marshalled in times of war. No one in the world can match our calvary, not even our missguided foes."
 MEN_Prince_of_the_Steppes_desc:0 "On banners and in schools, on newspapers and uniforms and even in yurts the face and symbols of Prince Demchugdongrub are found. Not one day will the Mongol go unreminded of the Prince and all he has done for the nation. It is under his banner that every Mongol of the steppes lives, workes, fights and dies. He is the Prince, and we are at last united under him: we shall not forget it."
 MEN_Japanese_Support_desc:0 "A saddening number of Mongols have been lead astray by the lies of bandits and into rebelion, even capturing our capital city.
