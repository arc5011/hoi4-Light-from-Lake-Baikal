state_lore_desc.362: "If Xuzhou in Han territory is the gateway to Beijing and Shanghai, then Chamdo in Kham is the gateway to Lhasa. Chamdo, which means 'the confluence of waters' in Tibetan, is home to four major rivers and countless lakes of all sizes. As the central city of the Kham region in Tibet, Chamdo is the crucial passage one must cross after the Jinsha River to reach Lhasa. Whether it's an army or merchants, all must pass through Chamdo before reaching Lhasa, hence the saying 'to govern Tibet, one must first secure Kham.' It has always been a strategic military point.\n\nThe main inhabitants of Chamdo are the Khampa Tibetans, who have closer ties to the Han territory than those in Ü-Tsang (the Lhasa region). However, this does not mean that Chamdo is an easily defended place. For Han troops, the culture, customs, and natural environment here are vastly different from those in the Han regions. The Tibetan army in Chamdo can easily use the advantageous terrain and scorched earth tactics to fend off enemies several times their size. Moreover, the fearsome high-altitude sickness can quickly turn a brave plains soldier into a heart patient.\n\nThe most recent conflict involving the Tibetans was in 1953 when a retreating National Revolutionary Army clashed with the Tibetan army stationed in Chamdo. Demoralized, poorly equipped, and chaotically led, the National Revolutionary Army was ambushed and defeated by the Tibetans. Since then, Han soldiers from Xikang have not dared to cross the Jinsha River."

state_lore_desc.363_MEA: "In Outer Mongolia, large cities are few and far between, making Kürren extremely important in the region. It can be said that whoever controls Kürren controls Outer Mongolia.\n\nUlaanbaatar was founded in 1639 as the residence of the Khalkha Lama of Mongolia and was initially called 'Kürren,' meaning 'enclosed pasture.' Since then, the city's name has changed with the political climate: Kürren, Great Kürren, Imperial Kürren—until the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1921, when the Great Khural decided to rename the Imperial Kürren to Ulaanbaatar, the 'Red Hero City.' After the defeat of the Mongolian People's Army by Prince De and the Japanese, the city's name was changed back to Kürren. In a daze, it seems as if everything here has returned to the Qing dynasty.\n\nToday, the city no longer has a Lama. But perhaps, one day, the red heroes will return."
