 POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "世人应当如何称呼德穆楚克栋鲁普亲王？蒙古的英雄？中华民族的叛徒？1902年，德王生于苏尼特右旗，是黄金家族第三十一代传人，那木济勒旺楚克亲王的独子。六年后，德王经爱新觉罗皇室批准，承袭了父亲的郡王头衔，又被灌输了中华文化的精粹。古今中外的各色历史人物中，德王最崇拜的便是自己的祖先——成吉思汗。此后，他一生都在追求成吉思汗的遗产。\n\n1931年，德王继任锡林郭勒盟长。茫茫蒙古草原，此时仿佛换了人间：大清帝国灭亡，以北洋政府为中央的中华民国取而代之，却在俄国的阴谋策应下丢失了外蒙古。时逢乱世，德王决定趁此机会搏上一把。后来的九一八事变让德王利用南京的恐惧发起泛蒙古自治运动。谈判最终由于蒋介石及其追随势力的大汉族主义而破裂。蒙古独立建国的强烈愿望，驱使德王采用了最后的手段——向关东军求助，即使他很清楚关东军笑里藏刀的真面目。\n\n多年的奋战，部分实现了德王的梦想。大东亚战争九年后，蒙古自治政府消灭了苏联傀儡势力，并在西伯利亚干涉之后收复了失地。尽管他取得了丰功伟绩，但蒙古尚未统一，更遑论独立了。法理上，蒙疆仍然是汪精卫及其走狗的附庸；实际上，蒙疆也仅仅是关东军的封地。东蒙古的土地仍被满洲控制，外蒙古的抵抗搅得亲王寝食难安。\n\n有人将他鄙弃为羞辱了成吉思汗灵魂的叛徒，也有人批判他是一个做春秋大梦的附庸暴发户。对于这些评价，德王心里反而不无同感。可他绝不愿追随前宗主溥仪的脚步，甘做日本的傀儡。南京政府公布现代化计划后，德王警惕地发觉，革命的风暴即将重临大东亚。或许现在就是他证明自己不辱成吉思汗后裔之名的最后关头，从压迫者手中解放蒙古的最后机会。"

 men.2.d:0 "我们的军队在最近几周已经不再看好德王和他的政权，显然最后的结果并未出乎我们的意料。一小部分随行人员和保镖护送德王——如今“蒙疆”这个名字唯一的象征，去到满洲国。我国政府中有许多人要求对蒙疆实施再征服，并且声称不让秩序恢复是不负责任的表现。然而另一些人早已厌烦这一切，并且再也不想搭理蒙古和失败的德王的烂摊子。"

 men.4.t:0 "王公大获全胜！"
 men.4.d:0 "今天，我们取得了胜利！叛乱已经结束了，蒙古已经得救了。现在正在进行的就只有最后的清理工作，随着秩序的恢复，所有来自日本的额外援助也将撤出。尽管在蒙古这样的地方，战斗从未真正停止，但很显然，和平的重现已经是板上钉钉的事实了：天空再也不会响起雷鸣般的炸弹爆炸声，地面再也不会因马蹄的踏过而颤抖。德王松了口气，蒙古的骑士们再一次紧随其后。"
 men.4.a:0 "一切本就应当如此。"
 men.5.t:0 "我们的合法领土"
 men.5.d:0 "德穆楚克栋鲁普王，以他那伟大的智慧，在很久以前就为蒙古设想了一个更好、更强大、更团结的未来。为了这个宏伟的目标，他已经辛苦奋斗了数十年，蒙古的人民，也出于普遍的忠诚与德王力量的正义而与他站在一边。而唯一的例外，是那些被孤立的、生活在共产赤祸之下的蒙古人。在蒙古的西方，他们散布着他们的污秽，对自己合法的统治者视而不见。就在最近，我们还刚刚与一位共军将军领导的部队交过手。不过现在我们终于团结起来了，我们终于可以解放那些生活在人民革命委员会统治之下的人们，从而让我们的人民真正团结起来了。"

 men.6.d:0 "蒙古草原的历史一直围绕着分裂与相互争斗，这给了生活在此的人民们一个教训——团结就是力量。从最早的匈人联盟，到1206年闻名世界的蒙古帝国，都证明了，当蒙古部落们聚集起力量，联合为一体，他们将无可阻挡。但我们一次又一次地陷入内斗，把自己当作中国人的奴隶。而在世界大战，在我们伟大领袖与日本朋友的帮助下，蒙古再一次将自己的人民团结起来。跟随冒顿单于和成吉思汗的脚步，几个世纪以来，他第一次以自己的名义将人民团结起来，尽管并非所有人都认同，但他似乎成功在蒙古的伟大统治者中赢得了自己的位子。\n\n而美丽的蒙古草原在今天又迎来了分裂与流血，就在前几周，来自土匪和共产主义者的叛军席卷了蒙古大草原，使我们自己的武装部队措手不及，并再次分裂了我们的人民。凭借着运气和诡计的结合，这些流寇占据了上风，甚至占领了我们的首都乌尔嘎，红军称之为“乌兰巴托”。这决不能接受！蒙古人再也不会在背后被中国人刺伤的情况下与他的同胞兄弟们作战了。我们伟大的亲王德穆楚克栋鲁普已经号召每一个真正的蒙古人以一夫当关万夫莫开的勇气和热情捍卫他们的国家和君主。我们将打败这些强盗，将库伦从他们的手中解救出来，让这些愚蠢的傻瓜们将知道背叛的代价。"

 men.7.t:0 "来自日本的炸弹！"
 men.7.d:0 "乌兰巴托已经被死亡与毁灭吞没！那些日本懦夫知道我们缺少防空措施，开始了对我们的军队与人民的无耻轰炸。毫无荣誉的日本人在他们政府的支持下进行着对无辜者的恐吓，甚至对无法自卫的平民发动攻击。他们的喷气式飞机知道自己根本无需惧怕我们的刀枪，大胆地从乌兰巴托上空俯冲而下，向我们的道路和建筑物投掷炸弹和导弹。尽管普通人被吓得肝胆俱裂，但我们的军队遭受着更大的伤害，来自天空的炸弹与子弹屠杀着战士们，在广阔的蒙古草原上四处收割无处藏身或无处可逃的人畜。这根本不是什么战争，更不是什么战斗，这是可耻的谋杀。"
 men.7.a:0 "懦夫！"
 men.8.t:0 "一场快速的战争"
 men.8.d:0 "我们与德穆楚克栋鲁普亲王的通信以及我们自己部署的飞行员共同描绘了发生在蒙古草原的美好画面。在现代空中力量、蒙古忠诚者和我们自己的物质支持之下，蒙古叛军的命运早已被决定。似乎很快，蒙古大草原就会再次获得安全，而亚洲也将恢复和平。"
 men.8.a:0 "理应如此。"
 men.9.t:0 "战争仍在持续"
 men.9.d:0 "显然，蒙古局势的发展未必对日本有利。亲王未能夺得主动权或平定赤匪的叛乱，浪费了我们的慷慨援助。随着战争的继续，我们已经无法看任何好处，我们的将军们逐渐对我们的蒙古盟友失去了耐心。无论如何，我们必须改变当前的政策，要么我们自己下场结束起义，要么干脆甩手不干。"

 men.10.a:0 "旭日依旧至高无上。"
 men.11.t:0 "新的辅助部队"
 men.11.d:0 "我们在日本帝国陆军的友人已遣回第一批蒙古受训生服役。尽管他们人数变少了，但他们的战斗意志却强韧如钢，与之前相比宛若云泥之别。他们自矜所受过的残酷的训练，对软弱之人没有半点怜悯之心。他们站的笔直，军装上的每颗纽扣都整齐有序，这些人已被日本人从柔软的陶土，烧制成天皇与亲王的利剑。"

 men.12.d:0 "Status Report 57A - North China Area Army (TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY)\n\nFOREWORD: Prince Demchugdongrub's forces of the Mongol United Autonomous Government has been battling the forces of Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal's rebel government in the far steppes of Mongolia. Mongolia, while a backwater compared to the riches of Manchuria and China, is still a vital communications and logistics hub for transport through Beijing. As such, Prince Demchugdongrub's forces should be aided by the forces of the North China Area Army as much as possible. Colonel Kodohara, representing our Chief of Staff had come up with three proposals:\n\n(a.) The provision of air support from the 17th and 33rd Fighter Groups, as well as the bomber group of the Genzan Kokutai. The lowest possible commitment we can make, this would still mean significantly to the Prince's forces - intelligence reports have stated that the air capacities of Tsedenbal's rebels are lacking.\n\n(b.) Same as option (a.), but with the additional provision of the 33rd Reserve Battalion - as an advisor group for the Prince's forces on the ground. This would increase the land capabilities of the Mengjiang Army - but might be seen as a waste of resources if the Prince loses the war in the steppe.\n\n(c.) Same as option (a.), but with the added provision of the 2nd Armoured Brigade. The heaviest commitment we are able to make, this would increase the Prince's chances of victory exponentially - at the cost of massively lost political capital if the Prince were to be defeated.\n\nSigned: Lieutenant General Ishihara Tadachi, GHQ Outer Mongolia Observatory Group."

For him, today's bombing run was merely another mission - whoever the targets were to be. Civilian or military, the Outer Mongolia Area Army couldn't take any chances - any potential resupply base for Tsedenbal's forces was a threat to the success of the campaign.\n\n\"No resistance, eh Cap? They'd usually swarm us with ack-ack by now!\" shouted Ito's (perhaps, overly) enthusiastic, door gunner.\n\n\"Shut the fuck up, Takayama, just focus on hitting your targets.\"\n\nTakayama cocked back his light machine gun's bolt, and loaded up high-explosive rounds. He'd been on enough missions to know which missions involved \"soft\" targets and which ones involved \"hard\" targets. Today's mission was \"soft\" - so far. At least until several airburst rounds scattered around the helicopter - maybe this target would not be as \"soft\" as Suzume-1-A expected.\n\n\"Bakayama, take out that fucking AA gun on the right! Everyone hang on, we're going in hot!\" shouted Ito.\n\n\"Suzume-1-A, Suzume-1-A! We took a hit! Going do-\", as the helicopter next to Ito exploded in a beautiful orange plume.\n\n\"Suzume-1-A to all Suzume-1 units, finish your runs, we're off for today.

While many were killed in the initial blast the true mauling came when the foolhardy commander ordered a screaming charge on the new foe.

While Prince Demchugdongrub has repeatedly assured our commanders that the Mengjiang Army will suffice for the operations in the steppe, and that \"victory is within our grasp\", his claims get less and less convincing with each passing day.\n\nThis presents us with a bubbling, but still manageable crisis, especially among the notoriously insubordinate Kwantung Army. Some of the more jingoistic and independent-minded officers want to directly drag Tokyo into the Mongolian rebellion, but this could lead to a dangerous precedence of wasting men, resources and materiel into small-scale conflicts that our proxies should be able to solve by themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the idea of direct intervention isn't that bad, as it gives us an opportunity to experiment with airborne and helicopter tactics in coordination with armoured and motorised thrusts - a doctrinal boost in an ever-modernising battlefield. In addition, it also gives some of our newly-graduated airmen a proving ground - the skies of Mongolia are vast, and there's little opposition to shoot them down.\n\nLastly, it will remind Prince Demchugdongrub to not get cocky in his internal affairs, and hopefully this would be the end of our massive investments in the Mongolian conflict."

While this odd mix of competence and incompetence was sufficient for peacetime operations such as anti-bandit raids as well as basic garrisoning, this shall not suffice for an actual war, or a large-scale rebellion.\n\nWith the escalation of Tsedenbal's rebellion, it would be wise for us to pour in more trained and effective assets into the North China Area Army. Specifically, deploying motorised and airborne assets would be useful for us to intervene readily in the Mongolian steppes in case Prince De's government falls to Tsedenbal's forces. In any case, we should ready forward cadres of these units and send them to Mengjiang as soon as possible - to act as forward operating units, as well as advisors for the Mengjiang National Army.\n\nHopefully, with this deployment we can increase the fighting capabilities of the Prince's army - with luck, we can extend our influence far to the Northwest against the Russians."

Tsedenbal's horse cavalry and mounted infantry have proven to be scarily effective in wearing down the Mengjiang National Army, be it through hit-and-run raids or reconnaissance missions which lay traps for the Prince's army. Through our experience in Manchukuo and Gansu, elements of the North China Area Army have also proven themselves adept in cavalry tactics.\n\nIt would be wise for us to loan cavalry vedettes to the Prince's army, especially if they would be augmented by our superior airpower and electronics capabilities.

While previously deemed to be a necessary sacrifice in favour of concentrating our efforts in the Pacific and China proper, it has come to haunt us in the wake of Tsedenbal's rebellion.\n\nWhile an extra diversion of cavalry and horse transport units has made it easier for us to supply Prince De's forces in the field, we should focus on gaining an advantage over Tsedenbal's forces through our superior technological capabilities. Namely, extending the Kalgan rail network would do wonders to supplying Mengjiang's cities and towns, even beyond Kalgan itself. However, construction might be costly - considering the harshness of the terrain.\n\nWe can only hope that the Kalgan rail network's expansion would be a welcome addition to our ever-increasing investment in the Northeast, and would aid us in defeating Tsedenbal's rebellion even quicker - there are more pressing needs for our construction companies and resources."

 men.31.t:0 "The Northwestern Conference"
 men.31.d:0 "Prince De's administration stands on a platform of Mongolian nationalism guided by the benevolent Japanese hand, but anyone who looks at Mengjiang for more than five seconds knows that the concept is built upon a throne of lies. While this approach would have worked in the 1930s, when our influence over Asia was still in flux, it has been nearly 30 years since the establishment of Mengjiang - and the Mongol populace has not remained idle.\n\nIt would be wise for us to realign our dealings with Prince De to unite the mixed loyalties of the princelings under his purview - as an anti-Bolshevik front upholding the noble traditions of the Mongol nation, though ostensibly still under the firm, guiding hand of the Japanese. With this in mind, the North China Area Army has proposed that an All-Mongolian Conference of Unity is to be held in Beijing - neutral, safe ground away from the front lines, with the idea of forming a pan-Mongolian, anti Bolshevik front against Tsedenbal's forces.\n\nThose in attendance would be the high-ranking commanders of the Kwantung Army and the North China Area Army, as well as the Minister of Finance, Kanemaru Shin. With luck, we would be able to unite the disparate Mongol princes of the northwest, and make a concrete effort to ensure Tsedenbal's rebellion does not threaten our supremacy in the steppes."

 men.32.d:0 "In the far northwest of our Empire, what was once a relatively quiet backwater has erupted into open rebellion. The Tsagaan Mongol Ulus, led by former Bolshevik Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, has seized control of the far west from Prince Demchugdongrub's Mengjiang National Army. While a minor rebellion at present, losing Mongolia would mean losing our reaches into the far north and Central Asia, as well as threatening supply lines and our positions in Northern China. Should the war not go in our favour however, the hawks in the Imperial Japanese Army would have a sufficient warchest to knock down the standing of our administration.\n\nThe Japanese have sent sorties of Kenpeitai Agents across the border to keep a watchful eye over the recently recovered lands of our Empire. They arrived in great trails of heavy-duty military vehicles chugging across the Mongolian frontiers, secluding themselves from the National Army's high command. They were here to 'handle' communist guerrillas behind the frontline whilst we focused on the enemy, we were told by Tokyo, but their sinister appearance signaled as if they were here for much more than partisans. Unloading truckloads of equipment and arms, the uniformed agents drew particular attention from our own men who were apprehensive of such an unsettling presence.\n\nTheir silence was foreboding, as it seemed they refused to speak to anyone other than who they were permitted to. We thank them and shake their hands for their service now, but with whispers and suspicion of ulterior motives, must remain aware of their praetorian position within our borders."
